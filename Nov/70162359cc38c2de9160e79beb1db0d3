Reacting to the meeting of Northern states’ Governors with Northern  Emirs and Chiefs and Arewa leaders in topmost positions in the current regime held on Monday, the leaders reiterated it’s call for restructuring before the 2023 general elections. The communique reads: “The meeting coming aftermath of the ENDSARS protest when we should be putting heads together nationally to seek solutions to our problems is most distractive, divisive and made Nigeria widely scattered as against the ‘indivisibility’ and other non-sequitors that were regurgitated at the end of it. “Where would this country be heading to if we also decide to call our own meeting with our Governors and top officials in the Federal Government? We do not see any responsibility displayed by those who have been serially accused  of sectionalising our national government to allow such in sensibility, insensitivity and total subversion of the unity of the country that only exists on the lips of those behind  the meeting. It not also lost on us that the communique of the  meeting was making space for National Executive Council nominations to a sectional initiative as the utmost level of disregard to the rest of the country whom they are treating as serfs when we are supposed to joint and equal stakeholders in project Nigeria. “The meeting wondered the quality of humanity of  any group meeting  at this period of mournings  not to have a word of compassion for those that were recklessly murdered by state forces and hired thugs during the protests. “We reject the indecent approach to paste the peaceful protesters in dark colours. They made their demands clear and were orderly before the violent Nigerian state deployed armed soldiers  and thugs in 911 lorries  against them. “It is wickedness to place ‘our power’ above every other national interest by playing the “regime change” label on the peaceful protesters who were not armed like Boko Haram that the regime is chasing about with negotiations in the same spirit it has been cuddling and pampering killer herdsmen. “We do not see the thoughtfulness in the celebration of Northern youths not participating in ENDSARS protests as if they did not also loot like their deprived young people in other areas of the country which shows they are suffering the same thing. But instead of treating leprosy, our counterparts are dealing with eczema.<img class="size-full wp-image-1355727 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=640%2C671&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sit-at-home: We are totally in support of it ― Ohanaeze Ndigbo" width="640" height="671" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=286%2C300&amp;ssl=1 286w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=977%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=768%2C805&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=1466%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1466w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=55%2C58&amp;ssl=1 55w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=185%2C194&amp;ssl=1 185w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?resize=124%2C130&amp;ssl=1 124w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ohaneze-logo.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> “We foresaw all that is happening now, which is why we have been calling for restructuring as a multi-ethic country like Nigeria can only be run along federal lines. We were not oblivious of the damage the military did to this country by using fiat to create LGAs with headquarters in the villages of top shots mostly from the North. Kano state today has 44 Local Governments and Bayelsa has 80.When you want to recruit 10 policemen per LGA Bayelsa will have 80  and Kano 44O. That affects where the materials to be drawn into SARS and others are drawn.The inequalities multiply everywhere. And this is why we insist on restructuring of the country now before we go for any national election. “We make it abundantly clear to our colleagues from the core North that yesterday ended last night and never again shall this country be run the same old way. No section of the country can play any supremacist role again as if the rest of us are fools. “It is either we live together as equals under the same rules of engagement or we explore other options as dignified human beings. “We deeply mourn with all families who lost dear ones in the crisis we just went through and pray to God to comfort them. May those who wantonly destroyed lives pay grievously for their deeds.” Vanguard THE pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, yesterday, flayed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo describing him as an enemy of Yoruba people by not championing the region’s interest in the All Progressive Congress led government February 11, 2019 In "News" The formation of Miyetti Allah Vigilante, a nationwide security outfit by Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, has drawn the ire of other socio-cultural and political groups, such as the Yoruba’s Afenifere, Igbo’s Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Niger Delta’s PANDEF, who described its national outlook as unacceptable.
