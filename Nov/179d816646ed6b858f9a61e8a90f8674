The market capitalisation dipped N279 billion or 1.53 per cent to close at N17.892 trillion against N18.171 trillion on Monday. In the same vein, the All-Share Index lost 531.25 points or 1.53 per cent to close at 34,242.83 from 34,774.08 posted on Monday. The downtrend was further driven by losses in medium and large capitalised stocks among which are Nestle, Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries, Cadbury, and International Breweries. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Ltd., attributed the development to profit-booking across sectors after eight straight weeks of the market rally. Omordion said that the pullback was creating another new buy-in opportunity for the market. “We expect the NSE index to rebound before the week runs out after the profit-taking to sustain uptrend till the early second quarter of 2021,” he said. Market sentiment as measured by market breadth, was negative as 30 stocks declined, relative to 17 gainers.
