The French move risks escalating a long-running fight over how to make American tech multinationals pay a larger share of their taxes in the countries where they operate. Under EU law, American companies can declare their profits from across the bloc in a single member state — in most cases low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland or the Netherlands.

But Paris reached a deal with the administration of President Donald Trump to suspend the tax while seeking a global digital tax deal under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). But Trump has warned that punitive duties of 25 percent on $1.3 billion worth of French products, including the country’s renowned cosmetics and handbags.
