She disclosed this at the launch of her cosmetic outfit, the Cosmetics Manufacturing Hub, where she revealed how she suffered hormonal acne after giving birth. Narrating her story, “When I gave birth my skin turned into something different. So I had a lot of pimples, very horrible. “I tested different options, but there was something in the natural skin care products, though it didn’t give me 100 percent results when I learned and made it out properly in an ethical way I got the results I wanted. “Seeing me know, you will not know that I have suffered post hormonal acne and I know that post hormonal acne can do a lot of damage to an African woman. It makes you lose confidence in yourself, it can even stop a dream from berthing”, she said. She added “So that is how I came into this business, first to help myself and also to extend that help through these products to others who suffered the same. “I can tell you that over 70% of African women suffer hormonal acne, so it is a big deal.
