Barbe who was a former President of the American Medical Association, and a family physician from Missouri, USA, in his inaugural speech at the WMA’s virtual General Assembly said the WMA must continue to advocate for adequate personal protective equipment, appropriate facilities and medical equipment, and adequate support staff. “We must work with public health officials to pursue policies that reduce the frequency and severity of disease while at the same time allow for an orderly and safe conduct of business and education. “We must continue to let the science lead us and be vocal advocates for evidence-based treatment and safe and effective vaccines.” Barbe said the pandemic had made the intersection of health inequities and chronic disease even more apparent. “Those already experiencing health inequity are often those with chronic diseases who are also at increased risk for Covid-19.
