What was supposed to be an evening of celebration quickly turned into a blame-trading game after Al-Hadji Kamara headed into an empty net to bring the score to 4-4 in what was a game of two halves. Nigeria dominated from the blast of the whistle and went ahead through Alex Iwobi in the 4th minute. The lead was extended by Victor Osimhen before Iwobi grabbed his brace with a stunner. Samuel Chukwuze wiggled his way past the Sierra Leonean defence and added the fourth to make the lead seem unassailable. Sierra Leone began the comeback just before half-time after William Troost-Ekong failed to clear his line, paving way for Kwame Quee to slot the ball past an onrushing Maduka Okoye. The Leone Stars went ahead to score in the 72nd, 80th and completed the comeback in the 88th minute. With the draw, Nigeria still leads the group with 7 points while Sierra Leone has 2 points. The other teams in the group are Benin Republic and Lesotho. Victor Osimhen was stretchered off to sum up a difficult outing for the Super Eagles with early suggestions indicating a wrist injury for the Napoli forward. Osimhen sustained the inury when he fell on his wrist while challenging for the ball with one of the Leone Stars defenders.
