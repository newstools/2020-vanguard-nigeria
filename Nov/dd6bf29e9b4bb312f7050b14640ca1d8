He said: “This committee will want to see a situation where a comprehensive database of all IDPs and refugees in the country. This will bring about effective tracking mechanism for providing adequate care and protection to them. “And it will also help us in the process of appropriation to gauge the level of humanitarian need the commission is expected to cater for, and appropriate accordingly”.

Bashir Garba Mohammed told the committee that the sum of N5.7bn was appropriated for the agency as capital and recurrent expenditure in 2020, adding that the amount represent 36.5% increase from 2019.
