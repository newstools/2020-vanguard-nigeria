The newspaper quoting its sources said a vaccination group of approximately 10 million health workers has been identified. “We have moved into an advanced stage of building a database for the first priority group – frontline health care workers. The health care workers will receive the first dose during the immunisation drive, if and when a particular vaccine is cleared by the Indian regulator for commercial use,” the newspaper quoted its sources in the expert group on vaccine administration as saying. “We have received a substantial response from the states, 92 per cent of all government hospitals across all states have provided data. “Around 56 per cent of private-sector hospitals have provided data,” the source said.
