Gbajabiamila expressed sadness over the killings of the innocent rice farmers in a statement by his spokesman, Lanre Lasisi on Sunday in Abuja. The speaker said the incident had once again brought to the fore the need for more military action against the terrorists. He said it was unfortunate that at a time the country was focusing on self-sufficiency in rice farming, about 50 of the farmers were killed in a most gruesome manner. The Speaker commiserated with the families of the slain farmers, the people and government of Borno over the sad incident. He said the house was determined to provide necessary support, including the ongoing budgeting process to ensure that funds were allocated for security agencies to carry out their mandate of wiping out the terrorists. “It’s unfortunate that about 50 of our countrymen lost their lives to the barbaric and inhuman action of the insurgents at this time. “This incident is one too many for us as a country, here were innocent citizens going about their lives of looking for their daily bread to cater for their families,” he said. According to him, their lives should not go in vain, this should call for more action from our military. He said that the House of Reps was ready to give them all the necessary support, especially through budgetary allocation to deal decisively with the insurgents.
