National President of National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), Mrs Laraba Shoda, said in a statement issued on Monday in Abuja that “our prayer is that come, Nov. 9, Okonjo-Iweala will be declared the consensus director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). “This will make her the first African and the first woman to occupy the position. “Undoubtedly, Okonjo-Iweala is a shining light and a beam of hope to Nigerian women, African women and to women all around the globe.’’ Shoda called on Nigerian women, African women and women all around the world to continue to pray for Okonjo-Iweala as her victory would not only be for her, but for the entire womenfolk.
