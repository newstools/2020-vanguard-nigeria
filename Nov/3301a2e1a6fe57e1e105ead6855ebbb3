Kola Ogunkoya, the self-styled Afro Gbedu musician, was the artist churning out such melodious hits. However, after being away from the Nigeria music scene for many years, music fans are starting to wonder where Kola has been and what he has been up to. Potpourri caught up with the Afrobeat legend on WhatsApp and had a juicy conversation with the US-based Nigerian artist. On what has been happening to him, he said, “ It is a long story. Since it looks like the Nigerian entertainment industry gave up on us, the pioneers of Nigerian music, including the legends before my own time, and faced young musicians, with flashy lifestyles and quick money, I decided to go international, because going international has opened better doors for me”. On what he is up to currently, he stated, “I have a lot going on including rearranging my music to suit my new audience in America so that I can be on point. But for Nigeria, I just feel it is best to forget that side (Nigeria) for now, because it’s a small market in the world of music and has no future for its artists.” Kola Ogunkoya, 53, moved to the USA several years ago, after he was defrauded of a huge amount of money, the same period his brother was killed in front of a clubhouse in Lagos. With role models such as Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Kola Ogunkoya carved a niche for himself in the Nigerian music industry but it appears his memory is fast fading from the scene.
