The General Manager, Nigeria and Ghana Country lead, Nigeria, Folake Odediran, who also spoke at the ceremony, said Sanofi entered into a memorandum of understanding, MOU, a year ago to jointly address the rising burden of diabetes and hypertension in the State. Odediran said: “under the partnership, both parties set common goals to implement end-to-end healthcare initiatives to support patients in their health journeys. We set out to promote disease awareness and patient education across the state, train 400 healthcare workers, establish diabetes and hypertension clinics, support people living with diabetes, and provide quality affordable medicines for patients. “The Commission and Sanofi have since been working tirelessly to achieve these common goals. Therefore, it is a great privilege for me, and a humbling experience too, to see us successfully commission the Diabetes and Hypertension Clinics, DHC project in Delta State today. “The increasing burden of diabetes and hypertension is a major public health concern. This is because these diseases are not just health problems but also a development challenge as they impact the quality of life, undercut productivity and force many people and families into poverty due to catastrophic expenditures on treatment. Gaps exist in health care systems. “The DHC project is one of several healthcare initiatives under our partnership with the Commission. It aims to bring healthcare closer to the people and thereby eliminate some barriers which prevent people from accessing healthcare. “The DHC is a centre of excellence dedicated to supporting people living with diabetes and hypertension most especially at the primary level of care and in hard-to-reach communities. DHCs are well equipped, with the health workers well trained, to effectively manage diabetes and hypertension at primary care level and to refer patients when necessary”.
