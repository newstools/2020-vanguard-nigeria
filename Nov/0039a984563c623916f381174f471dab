He said, “our lecturers are not just talking about their salaries and the IPPIS System, the improvement of the facilities in our institutions, the essence of research and research grants are among other demands”. “All these affect both the lecturers and the students. We have been deceived by lip service for too long. Our institutions do not qualify to be ranked among the first 100 in the world. It is very unfortunate. Enough of politicking with our educational system”.
