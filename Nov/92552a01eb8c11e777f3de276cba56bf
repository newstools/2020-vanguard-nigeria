Vladimir Marugov was found dead in the sauna after his partner fled through a window in the outdoor hut and notified police about the attack some 25 miles west of the capital, the Moscow Times reported. The assailants tied up Marugov and the woman and demanded money before killing him with the crossbow, according to Reuters. They left behind the murder weapon before taking off in a car, which was later found in the nearby village of Istra, where affluent Russians have country homes known as dachas. Russia’s Investigative Committee the country’s equivalent of the FBI  did not name the victim, but he was identified by local media as Marugov, the owner of the Ozyorsky and Meat Empire sausage factories, the BBC reported. Since last year, he had been involved in a highly publicized property rights dispute with his ex-wife, poet Tatyana Marugova, almost five years after their divorce, according to the Moscow Times. It was not yet clear who was behind the attack and an investigation has been launched.
