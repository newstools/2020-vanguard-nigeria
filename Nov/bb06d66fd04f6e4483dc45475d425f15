Dikio told the monarchs that his actions and policies would be guided by consensus inputs of key stakeholders of which they play a major role He added that his focus would be effective  reintegration of ex-agitators. “We want to work with all tiers of government and those central to our new vision so that we can deliver the deliverables of the PAP. “This is essentially why I have come to meet with you today. I want you as royal fathers to help us restore that age-long respect for our institutions and our elders. Those are the fabrics that helps to preserve our traditions and culture. “We are people from riverine communities. There are things that are mostly peculiar to us and they come naturally with us. So we are going to recalibrate our trainings to take cognizance of those areas we have comparative advantage over otherd and enhance them. That to me will in the long run positively impact on our people. “Ultimately we want to synergise with all stakeholders so that we can make the Niger Delta a place to live and do business in”.
