West Brom seemed to be heading for a precious draw, after holding Jose Mourinho’s men for most of the match, but the baggies were hard done by an 88th-minute strike from Harry Kane. Despite being on the losing end, Ajayi produced a solid display that contributed to the Baggies conceding a lone goal against a potent Spurs attack, who have scored the 19 goals this season, only second to Chelsea on the goalscoring chart. The 26-year-old centre-back notably made a superb block to deny Son a clear attempt on goal in the 13th minute, going on to win 66.6 per cent of the duels involved in, making 4 interceptions and 11 recoveries in 90 minutes. Some Baggies fans took to Twitter to shower praises on Ajayi for his standout performance in a West Brom team that has struggled to perform this season after gaining promotion to the Premier League. Here are some reactions: Regardless of the amount of goals shipped in, I’d argue Semi Ajayi has been our best player so far this season..
