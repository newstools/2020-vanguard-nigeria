The police asked the demonstrators to leave via loudspeaker and tried to surround them, the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported. “We have a right to protest,” the crowd chanted. The participants carried banners with slogans such as: “Don’t tell me how to live” and “Get rid of the misogynist government.” The police have taken several people into custody, the PAP news agency reported. Rally organizers symbolically renamed a square in the city centre as “Women’s Rights Square.” Smaller rallies were held in other Polish cities, including Krakow and Wroclaw.
