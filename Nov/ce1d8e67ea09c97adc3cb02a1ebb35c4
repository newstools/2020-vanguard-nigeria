NCC Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, said this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. Adinde said that the Draft Consultation Document for the deployment of  5G in Nigeria has been produced and uploaded on NCC’s official website (www.ncc.gov.ng). He explained that the document defined the implementation plan for the deployment of 5G in Nigeria. “The NCC wishes to draw the attention of the general public to the fact that the Commission has not concluded plans for the deployment of the fifth-generation (5G) network. “It provides a background into the benefits of 5G technology and outlines the Commission’s plans and strategies for a successful implementation of 5G in Nigeria. “It presents guidelines for the relevant areas of the technology and the expectations of the Commission from the operators. “This plan takes into account the expectations of all the stakeholders in the communications industry in Nigeria,” he said. Adinde, however, said that Nigeria undertook 5G trials in selected locations within the country in collaboration with an operator in 2019. The trial, among others, was to study and observe health or security challenges the 5G network might present.
