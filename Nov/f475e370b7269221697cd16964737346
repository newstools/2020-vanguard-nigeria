The Alpha 1 HomeGuard-V007 is a modern Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Integrated Home Security and Automation System that monitors homes and offices for intrusion, burglary attempts, smoke, gas leaks, and fire. The system leverages encrypted Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Zigbee technologies to ensure a round-the-clock beam of security around the home.

The Alpha 1 Company Security Monitoring Centre will also receive the notifications and will immediately seek to confirm the situation at the home and to initiate a response by neighborhood security watch and government security forces.
