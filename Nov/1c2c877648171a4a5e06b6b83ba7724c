He added that the said officer while fielding questions from the Assistant Commissioner of Police at the State Police Command headquarters at the time claimed there was a cutlass in the deceased’s bag, a position Adio said was not true. Speaking before the State Panel of Inquiry investigating police brutality and extrajudicial killing, the manager said when the deceased checked into the hotel, he carried a bag which the deceased claimed contained money. The deceased’s father, Mr Rasheed Ayinla, had petitioned the panel stating that his son, Ismaila Rasheed was killed and robbed of N4 million in a hotel where he lodged along Iwo/Ibadan Expressway, Iwo, Osun State on August 18, 2020. He noted that two Police Officers, identified as ‘Odua and Aare’ from the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) were accommodated in the Guest House by the owner, Alhaji Dauda Adigun, on the consent of the Divisional Police Officer, (DPO) Iwo, DPO free of charge. He said “one of the officers of the SARS called me that they had shot dead one of the thieves that invaded the Guesthouse, but when I got to the room, I found Ismaila Rasheed in his pool of blood and I told them he is my guest and not a thief. “When they wanted to carry his corpse out of the hotel, I noticed that the bag he brought into the hotel the night before had been tampered with suggesting that its content was removed. “The police said he brought a cutlass into the hotel to rob but I vehemently opposed it and insisted that he did not lodge into the hotel with a cutlass. “We were taken to the Police Command Osogbo with the owner, a lady and myself over the issue. We met the two officers (Odua and Aare) and the Assistant Commissioner of Police. The ACP asked the two officers who shot the guest and Odua admitted to have killed him”. Also, in his testimony, the father of deceased, Alhaji Ayinla Rasheed, who could not control his emotion said his deceased’s while struggling for his life, called his wife to inform her he was shot by police before the wife subsequently called and told him. He said, “My son was killed after he was robbed of the money he wanted to use in buying ram in the northern part of Nigeria. “He called his wife informing her of the attack by the two SARS officers around 3:30 AM and the wife called me. Before we get to the scene when the day breaks, the police told us that he was killed. “The police handed over N977,000 to us which they claimed they recovered from his hotel room. They gave us N100, 000 for our transport fare. They called us on another day and gave us N100,000. “The ACP later invited the wife of the deceased and myself, he pleaded with us and when we are going he gave us N700,000. He claimed that the money was not part of the one they recovered from the deceased. “He later sent another N300,000 to the wife and N20,000 as transport.” Vanguard News Nigeria By Shina Abubakar ― Osogbo As the Osun State panel of inquiry set up to investigate Police brutality and extra-judicial killings in the state commenced its sitting Thursday, a victim's father Rasheed Ayinla alleged that his son, Ismaila was killed in cold blood by the disbanded SARS personnel to steal… November 12, 2020 In "News" The Osun State Police Command has said it has arrested officers of the Special Anti Robbery Squad, SARS, who allegedly shot a 30 year old resident of Iwo in the state, Tunde Nafiu.
