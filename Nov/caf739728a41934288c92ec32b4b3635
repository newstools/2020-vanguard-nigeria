The victim was, thereafter, taken to the General Hospital in Ifo, where he was confirmed dead. “Also injured were one Muhammed, a trailer driver and one Olalekan Alade, who was also dispossessed of his phone by the hoodlums, while five other different phones snatched from different people were recovered from them,” he said.
