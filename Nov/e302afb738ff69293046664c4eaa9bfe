Kyle Rittenhouse “is out of jail,” Lin Wood wrote, adding special thanks to actor Ricky Schroder and My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell, an ally of US President Donald Trump, for contributions which put them “over the top.” Video footage shows a white man alleged to be Rittenhouse shooting dead the two protesters, named by The New York Times as Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August. He badly wounded one other man. Rittenhouse, described as being an enthusiast of right-wing militant groups in the US, reportedly went to the city to protect it from “rioters” during days of demonstrations against police brutality. The protests had erupted after a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot multiple times in the back by a white officer at point blank range, as his three young sons watched. Blake survived, but doctors have said he may never walk again. Blake’s shooting came three months after the police killing of another African American, George Floyd, ignited the largest wave of civil unrest in the US in decades. Protests in Kenosha began peacefully the night Blake was shot, but descended into violence for several nights running. It culminated August 25, when Rittenhouse is accused of taking his rifle to the streets. Trump, who has a long history of readiness to court right-wing extremism, has expressed sympathy for Rittenhouse and called the allegations against him “an interesting situation.” [AFP] Vanguard News Nigeria With chants of “One person, one vote!” and “No justice, no peace!” a crowd of about 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside a Wisconsin courthouse Saturday to denounce police violence and share messages of change, a week after an officer shot Jacob Blake in the back and left the 29-year-old Black man… August 30, 2020 In "Foreign" Claiming the mantle of the “law and order” candidate, President Donald Trump is offering himself as the leader best positioned to keep Americans safe, a day after Democratic rival Joe Biden assailed him over the deadly protests that have sprung up on his watch.
