The Commission said the collaboration has become imperative because it would no longer be able to achieve its mandate without strengthening collaboration with citadels of knowledge The Chairman, Board of Commissioners of NCC, Prof. Adeolu Akande, stated this during a courtesy visit by NCC Board members to Bayero University, Kano (BUK) at the weekend as part of activities lined up for the 2020 NCC Board retreat held in Kano State. According to Akande, who praised the university for producing Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, the NCC superintends a sector that is knowledge-driven and therefore, would not be able to achieve its mandate without strengthening collaboration with citadels of knowledge like BUK  and other higher institutions of learning to produce the knowledge base needed to support the growth of the telecoms sector. “The NCC is superintending a sector that is knowledge-driven. In the absence of the citadels of learning, one could only imagine what would have become of the communications industry. So, if we come to Kano, we need to come to the prime centre of learning in Kano and other universities across the state,” he said. Thanking the university further for “contributing” Danbatta to the industry,  Akande said the sector, which NCC regulates, has also benefited immensely from the knowledge being imparted by the university. He said the BUK has produced a good ambassador, excellent professional, and a man with administrative acumen and superb human relations in Prof. Danbatta. “Hence, the Board of NCC decided to visit Bayero University with the EVC, who is a ‘homeboy’ and to show our appreciation for the services of the EVC, an outstanding product of the university, has been rendering to the nation at the NCC. We are here also to show that we work together and our coming to Bayero University would be an expression of appreciation of Danbatta’s good work at the NCC,” he said. In his remarks, Danbatta said all the achievements “we have recorded as NCC can be attributed to the team spirit and cooperation between the Management and Board of NCC even as we are poised to achieve more,” adding that “Our profound prayer is that we leave the NCC better than we met it.” While thanking the university’s management for hosting the NCC’s, Danbatta used the opportunity to also congratulate Prof. Sagir Abbas for his appointment as the 11th Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the university. While expressing delight to receive the NCC Board, Prof. Abbas noted that the school management cancelled all engagements to receive the board in order to show the university’s high regards for Danbatta, whose name, he said, cannot be omitted in the history of Bayero University. “Prof. Danbatta has served the university diligently, as a lecturer, as head of the department, as Dean, as director and he was also a former VC in Kano University of Science and Technology, but wherever he goes, you find him relating to his base. “So, we hold him in very high esteem and we are always happy to see him and his team discharging the national assignment he is saddled with and Bayero University is proud to be associated with him. We have no doubt that the Board and Management of NCC will enjoy him more as he begins his second term in office,” he said. According to the Vice-Chancellor, the university has received many donations of computers, iPads, and other interventions such as professorial endowments from NCC, all of which, he said, have had positive impacts on the university’s academic programmes. He, however, appealed for more digital assistance by the Commission in supporting the university more in the area of its ongoing restructuring to fully accommodate virtual learning into its system in view of the current reality globally where ICT is mediating the lecturer-student interaction.
