As a key contributor to ICT development in Nigeria, for over two decades of operating in the country, Huawei serves more than half of Nigeria’s population with ICT services and through several programs, Huawei has constantly remained committed to training Nigerians in digital skills and cultivating ICT talents to build a fully digital economy. The company has launched several ICT Talents Eco-system development programs so that local ICT talents can be nurtured and developed to the point of global recognition.
