Have you ever thought about the concept of independence at old age? A highly contradictory thought but a valid one still. It’s a known fact that we all tend to get more dependent as we age, especially because our physical strength depreciates as our bodies respond to the weight of age. But when it comes to financial dependence, especially at old age, that’s an entirely different ball game. People hardly ever like bearing the burden of carrying someone financially all their lives. Even if you think it’s morally right, it can be very exhausting.
Since old age is inevitable and retirement is equally as sure as the passage of time and seasons, how can we make hay while the sun still shines? This is no new concept but that’s where an adequate pension plan comes in. Think about it this way, a savings account which you spend most of your life funding, no matter how much stipends you put in periodically will definitely become a lifesaver sometime in the future when you can’t work anymore. It’s always a lot easier than depending on a distant relative or your children when age comes knocking. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1494309" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=640%2C636&#038;ssl=1" alt="Investment One Pensions" width="640" height="636" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=1024%2C1017&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=768%2C763&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=195%2C194&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?resize=131%2C130&amp;ssl=1 131w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investment-One-Pensions.png?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> If this piece got you thinking, Investment One Pensions is a great way to begin.
