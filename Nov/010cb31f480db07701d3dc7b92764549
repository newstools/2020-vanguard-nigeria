Represented by Tom Itua, Eromosele said “We have been told by experts that 70 million people are affected by stroke worldwide out of these cases, 16 million cases recorded annually.” He urged the federal government to recognize the Hospital’s effort by giving them the support they need to do more. In his remarks, the Chief Medical Director of UBTH, Prof. Darlington Obaseki disclosed that stroke patients respond better to treatment when they are treated in a dedicated ward, rather than in an open ward. He noted that the neurology unit of UBTH is the pioneer stroke ward and the biggest in the country. He said “Beyond the neurology family, so many persons are not aware of the fact that UBTH pioneered the treatment and management of stroke patients in a dedicated ward. “It has been proven objectively that there are better outcomes of stroke patients when they are treated in a dedicated ward rather than in an open ward. “We are challenging the team to go beyond what the previous team had from acute management of stroke to hype acute management of stroke.” He said the management of the institution would continue to provide the conducive environment for the experts to thrive. On his part, the head of the stroke unit, Prof. Frank Imarhiagbe disclosed that over 2,500 acute stroke patients have been admitted and treated in the ward since inception.
