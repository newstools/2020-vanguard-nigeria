Hear him: “Samples were collected from patients and sent to the laboratory. We have received results and the results point to yellow fever as cause of deaths we heard of in those areas. “The result we have received is helping to move us to a more definitive action, while we still wait a final authentication from the Reference Regional Laboratory in Dakar”. Saying that 22 deaths have been recorded as a result of the disease, with seven additional cases being managed at the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba, he assured  that there was no cause for alarm.

We assure residents that every thing is being done to ensure that it does not escalate. “Before now, there was a planned yellow fever preventive campaign to begin November 20, we are moving it closer to enable us tackle what is before us,” he added. Maintaining that yellow fever usually manifest much more bizzare symptoms than malaria, Ononye said; “some patients are with fever, body pains, headache, vomiting with or without blood. Some begin to bleed from the nose or mouth. Some of those we have just convulse and some recover very well even without coming to the hospital”.
