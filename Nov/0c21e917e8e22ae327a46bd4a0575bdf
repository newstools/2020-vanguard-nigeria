Olawoye said that the members did not issue him or the state government any strike notice. Reacting to the strike action Olawoye said “I am not aware of this issue. I was not given any notice of the strike action. “I am in Ibadan and was just told that LOAN officers went on demonstration. “They didn’t give me any notice. I am surprised.
