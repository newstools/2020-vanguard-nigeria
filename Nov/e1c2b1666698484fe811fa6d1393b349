Led in evidence by the EFCC counsel, Rotimi Jacobs SAN, Micheal said N750million was allegedly transferred from the ONSA special account to Reliance Referral Hospital Limited’s account with First Bank. He added that N650million was also transferred to Acacia Holding Limited’s account with EcoBank, while another N600million and N200million were transfered to the company’s account with UBA. “Between Sept. 27, 2013 and April 16, 2015, N50 million was credited to Reliance Referral Hospital’s account. “Based on responses from the banks involved, as investigating officer, we found out that money was transferred to several individuals and companies. “When we went through the account statement, we asked the second defendant (Aminu Babakusa) the reason for this. “He informed us that the money was used to hire Clerics to pray for the nation as regards Boko Haram crisis. “When we asked him to provide the names, contacts and phone numbers of the clerics he hired to pray for the nation, he mentioned only two,” he said.
