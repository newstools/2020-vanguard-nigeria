Dr Monday Igbafen, Branch Chairperson of ASUU in the University, revealed how members of staff of the university were suffering as a result of non-payment of their salaries for four months. A statement he issued in Benin said: “We call on the Edo State Government to urgently intervene in the crisis of payment of staff salaries in the university. ” This is in order to avoid the continuation of the ongoing nationwide strike in the university after the eventual resolution of the strike at the national level”. He said that he and his colleagues were worried over the continued silence of the state government on the matter. Igbafen advised that the salary crisis in the university should be sorted out during the period of nationwide strike, so that students could resume when the strike was called off. Edo State Government, in its reaction, through the Special Adviser to the governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, denied owing anyone salaries and emoluments. Osagie said that the state government was up to date with its obligations to all cadres of workers and public officers. “The state government has never reneged on its obligations to pay workers and other cadre of staff their due wages and salaries,” Osagie said.
