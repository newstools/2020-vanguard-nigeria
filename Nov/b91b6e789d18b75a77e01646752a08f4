Primary School, Araromi, Iwo, said they had witnessed the giant strides of Governor Oyetola and are ready to support and work for his re-election in 2022, insisting that the governor has done well and deserves a second term. Speaking at the event, an elder of the party and Asiwayu of Iwoland, Barrister Gbadegesin Adedeji, appreciated the governor for fulifing many of his campaign promises to the people of Osun. He said despite the challenges, Oyetola has done well since he assumed office.

He also commended the party faithful for canvassing support for the governor’s re-election. Responding, the State’s Deputy Governor, Mr Benedict Alabi, thanked the people for rallying support for the governor’s re-election, and expressed optimism that the APC would retain power in 2022. He said the administration of Governor Oyetola had performed creditably well and deserves another term. “We thank party members for gathering here today to show support for the re-election of Mr Governor. Without doubt, our Administration has done well and we have fulfilled many of our campaign promises to the people of Osun. I therefore urge you all to continue to mobilise support for our party and Governor Oyetola’s candidacy ahead of the 2022 governorship election. “In Osun West, the government has embarked on a number of developmental projects, including rehabilitation of health facilities and roads. We also facilitated the siting of Federal College of Education in Iwo. “Also, despite the limited resources at the disposal of the State, we have continued to pay salaries and pensions as and when due, in fulfilment of Mr. Governor’s campaign promise. The governor had also recently approved the implementation of the new minimum wage for workers in the State. This shows that he is genuinely concerned about the welfare of the people,” Alabi said. The campaign rally was attended by various party and government officials including the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji; former Speaker of the Osun House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Adejare Bello; local government chairmen in the State; and commissioners.
