The fallen tanker resulted in fire explosion, following the trail of the spilt petrol which affected 23 other vehicles parked close to the scene Lagos Sector Commander of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Olusegun Ogungbemide, said that road safety and fire servicemen were first prevented from getting to the scene by some hoodlums armed with dangerous weapons until security was beef up at the scene. He said that two corpses, identified as the tanker driver and his assistant, which were burnt beyond recognition,  were recovered at the scene. The FRSC boss said that the debris were being removed from the scene by FRSC heavy-duty tow truck along with Julius Berger equipment. According to him, the road is now open for movement but FRSC officials are still on ground controlling traffic and advised motorists to seek alternative routes. Ogungbemide enjoined motorists to always obey all traffic rules and regulations by driving safe and staying safe at all times. The Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu also confirmed the accident. Oke-Osanyintolu said that the operation commenced with police protection until the group of assailants grew larger and caused significant damage to vehicles and threats to life of responders personnel. He said that rescue team had earlier been forced to suspend the recovery operation for safety reasons. The DG said that the attack was part of a very worrisome trend of first responders being attacked in the course of their duties. Oke-Osanyintolu, however, urged Lagos residents to refrain from endangering the lives of emergency responders while  carry out their lifesaving duties. [NAN] Vanguard News Nigeria.
