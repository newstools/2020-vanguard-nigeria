Onafeko’s appointment was announced on Monday, September  28, 2020. The Forum, in a statement by its coordinator and former Minister of Communication, Gen. Tajudeen Olanrewaju (retd), said: “This is totally unacceptable. There are a lot of indigenous Lagos State natives who are capable to fill the appointment. This one appointment begs the issue at stake.” The statement reads: “The State Assembly has not set a good example. The overwhelming majority of the members are non-indigenes and have brought nothing beneficial or significant to the people of Lagos. Most of the laws passed by the House have benefited only a few mandarins.” Olanrewaju, a former GOC 3rd Armoured Division, argued that: “This appointment must not stand. It’s time Lagosians began to fill vacant places and spaces. The State Assembly should redeem its public policy image against the indigenes.” Vanguard News The Lagos State House of Assembly has appointed Mr Olalekan Onafeko as the Acting Clerk of the House.
