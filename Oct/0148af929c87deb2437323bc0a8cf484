While she has not made any physical outing anywhere she has made sure her voice was loud and clear. First to feel her wrath is the governor of Rivers State Nyesome Wike who warned against any form of protest in his State. Next was President Muhhamadu Buhari, to whom she wrote an open letter which she posted on her Instagram page.
