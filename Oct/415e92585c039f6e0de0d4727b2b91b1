Newsmen gathered that trouble started when the convoy of an Army General was blocked by #EndSARS protesters around the popular Effurun Roundabout, Uvwie LGA, from passing through the city en route to Port Harcourt. The protesters in their large numbers barricaded the roads leading in and out of the city, preventing vehicular movement all through.
