On Saturday October 17, 2020 Nigerians in Canada joined the March against Police brutality, Injustice, Corruption and Bad Governance. Cities who participated include Toronto, Ottawa, Sudbury, Saint John’s, Winnipeg, Halifax, Calgary and others. In Toronto, the event was scheduled for Dundas Square. At 12pm local time, the March began from Dundas Square all the way to Toronto City Hall.

He had this to say: “Today’s march was not a carnival, but a group of serious minded Nigerians who have made up their mind to ensure their country gets the needed change it deserves. We also have Non-Nigerians who joined the March today. I saw several friends with Caribbean roots who also joined us. It’s been too long and we are all tired of Police brutality, injustice, bad governance, corruption and many more. This is just the beginning”. Osaman also recounted his experience during his University days when his colleague Ibrahim Momodu was killed by a Police officer. He said: “Ibrahim Momodu was my colleague and friend. We were both studying Science Laboratory Technology, under the same major (Physiology/Pharmacology Major). We were all on Industrial Training in year 5 (2013) when his life was taken by the Police. It was one cold dark evening we will never forget. The entire class was rocked to the core. Our industrial training was almost suspended and we had to rally round the family members. Ibrahim was full of spirit, very jovial and loves to dress very well. Anytime he comes to class, you’ll always know he’s around.<img class="size-full wp-image-1479543 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VICTIM.jpg?resize=600%2C802&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="802" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VICTIM.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VICTIM.jpg?resize=224%2C300&amp;ssl=1 224w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VICTIM.jpg?resize=43%2C58&amp;ssl=1 43w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VICTIM.jpg?resize=145%2C194&amp;ssl=1 145w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VICTIM.jpg?resize=97%2C130&amp;ssl=1 97w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Ibrahim’s case wasn’t the only Police-related case I had to deal with whilst serving as Leader of our Class. During the same period of his demise, we had another incident with the Police. There’s another colleague of mine Shedrach who was in Biochemistry major. He was carrying his little relative at the balcony of his home one Friday evening when bullets rained down the roof, pierced his skull and went into his medulla. It was a miracle that he didn’t die instantly. We again rallied round and through much help by well-meaning individuals, he was able to secure healthcare at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH).<img class="size-full wp-image-1479514 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SARS2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SARS2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SARS2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SARS2.jpg?resize=58%2C39&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SARS2.jpg?resize=260%2C173&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SARS2.jpg?resize=195%2C130&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SARS2.jpg?resize=115%2C77&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> We later learned that there was a social wake keep nearby (popularly called ‘obito’) and the bullets could have been from trigger-hungry Policemen at the event. Shedrach’s educational ambition was put to an end by that sad incident as he could no longer speak properly nor coordinate himself. Till date I’ve not heard from him. Year 5 was a dreadful one for all of us. So when you see many Nigerians angry, it’s not just against the Nigerian Police. It’s against the entirety of Nigeria’s corrupt system. I have been seeing the recent social media dragging of the daughter of the alleged Police officer who killed Ibrahim. None of these will bring back the life of Ibrahim and many others. Ibrahim would have been a graduate today. This is one of the reasons I March”. Vanguard In the light of the recent global events, a lot of people are calling for the end of racism, social injustice, inequality, discrimination. Amongst them is Adodo Eddy Osaman - a Nigerian Training Specialist in Canada and an Advocate for Education and Youth Development. Osaman spoke with Vanguard Newspapers today.… June 9, 2020 In "News" As Nigerians celebrate the sexagenarian independence anniversary, those in diaspora were not left out. Today in the City of Brampton Ontario, the Nigerian Community also gathered to celebrate their country. We interviewed a well meaning Nigerian who attended the event - Adodo Eddy Osaman.
