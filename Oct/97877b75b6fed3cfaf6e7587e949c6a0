Jegede however was optimistic that despite the hitches, he would win. Recall that the Smart Card Reader could not initially read his card and was asked to step aside. Smart Card Reader could also not read the PVC of Jegede’s wife, Eno but his daughter voted without any hitch. The couple later voted about 10 minutes later. But speaking to newsmen after voting, Jegede accused INEC of creating a problem. “The commission should be asked why the card reader stopped functioning when it was his turn to vote. “INEC is creating a problem. Their machine stopped working when it was my turn to vote. I have to protest and they said the machine was rectified. “But despite all these hitches, there has not been major disruption. But I don’t know what is happening in remote areas. “The turnout has been massive, voters conducted themselves well. Am aware there is a pocket of violence in Ijomu area. I also heard of an incident of vote-buying. “In Owo for instance, a former commissioner led thugs to attack one Sadiq Obanoyen and injured him in a patrol vehicle. Jegede added that “These are incidences of violence. Unfortunately, it is happening. But by the grace of God, we will still win.” Vanguard THE candidates of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Mr. Rotimi Akerdolu, SAN, and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, SAN, were locked in a tight race, yesterday, in the Ondo State governorship election.
