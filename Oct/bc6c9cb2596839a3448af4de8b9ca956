She said, “The goal of fiscal interventions will be to keep the economy active through carefully calibrated regulatory/policy measures designed to boost domestic value-addition, de-risk the enterprise environment, attract external investment and sources of funding. “Improving the tax administration framework to optimize government revenue is a major thrust of the Administration’s Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative (SRGI).” In his remarks, the Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba said that the administration had achieved the January-December budget cycle and would work hard to maintain same.
