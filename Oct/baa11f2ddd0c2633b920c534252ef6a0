Comrade Bankole added that it is our hope that this development will open a new vista of collaboration, trust and understanding between government and labour in the State while reassuring the governor of the unalloyed loyalty and support of workers to his administration. “No doubt, the payment of new minimum wage to civil and public servants will greatly motivate the workers for enhanced productivity and efficiency”, the NLC Chairman disclosed. Some of the workers who spoke with our correspondent, expressed their happiness for the payment of the minimum wage, saying this was a welcome development. Expressing his delight, Commander Oluwafemi Odukalu of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Agency (TRACE) said, “to be honest I was expecting something close to that increment but when I saw the actual amount added, I was overwhelmed because I didn’t expect that much” thanking the governor for fulfilling the promise. On her part, Mrs Oluwatosin Owotomo of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology appreciated the Governor for keeping the promise made and for not paying lip service to the welfare of workers. Some of the lower-level officers, it was gathered got as much as a 100% salary raise, while those on higher grades got “substantial increment’. The State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Alhaji Abdulwaheed Odusile said, “it is a good thing, the governor has promised the labour that he would pay and this is another promise made and a promise kept”.
