Speaking on behalf of the monarch, his  Secretary, Mr Toyin Ajamu, said, “We had been trying to appease the protesters since morning. The protesters, who introduced themselves as students, came to the palace on Saturday and we addressed them. We learned that one person died in the process.” “Today, some of the aggrieved youth set to burn fire at the various junction leading to the police station. To prevent the matter from degenerating, Kabiyesi directed some of his chiefs to appease the protesters but they started stoning whoever came their way and threw tyres into the station.” “The Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare visited the palace shortly before the attack on the palace while returning from the visit to the family of the deceased. They shattered windscreens of vehicles in the palace, vandalised the palace and burnt down a motorcycle.” “We were only saved because there were burglar proofs on the windows. Nobody was injured but about 10 vehicles were vandalised, including the vehicle of Chairman. Christian Association of Nigeria, Ogbomoso North Zone, Rev. Tayo Adeyanju. The police were running for dear life so they couldn’t respond on time. “Luckily, Kabiyesi escaped because the meeting was being held at the dining section and not the sitting room. The protesters were not able to get to where the meeting was being held.” Vanguard …Buhari, Osinbajo's daughters, celebrities join campaign …Protests spread home and abroad …Kaduna protesters want squad officers deployed to fight terrorism in N/East By David Royal, Tunde Oso, Lagos, Shina Abubakar, Osogbo, Boluwaji Obahopo, Lokoja, Adeola Badru, Ibadan, James Ogunnaike, Abeokuta The nationwide #EndSARS protests gained more global support, yesterday, with… October 11, 2020 In "News" Violence continued to erupt in Ogbomosho city, Oyo State on Sunday as the EndSARS protest continued after the killing of Jimoh Isiaka.
