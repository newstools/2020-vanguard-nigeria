Unlike many who were only imbued by the allure of the protests, Nsikan has a valid reason, not only for the #EndSars vibe but for the total reform of the Police Force. According to her in a post on her Instagram page, she was lending her voice to the struggle because she had faced the pain of losing loved ones to the so-called people who are supposed to protect the people. Hear her : “22 years ago I lost my dad to a stray bullet from a police officer. 20 years later I lost my elder brother to a gunshot in front of my parents’ house from the police too.” “I have personally felt the pain. It has been there for many years. It has been a struggle, I have had my silent cries and I have picked myself back up. It took a while but thank God the revolution has begun,” she added. Nsikan Isaac is the creative director of Leia Cole Studios. An alumni of Atlanta School of Photography. She’s a petroleum engineer, actress and producer. She also has a certificate in the business of Film (The Open University).
