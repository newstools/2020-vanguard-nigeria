The deceased, a Junior Secondary School 3 student was sent on an errand by her mother, last Wednesday, by 3 p.m, but never returned.

They have been into this rape business for long. All they do is to lure girls, especially minors into the room, rape and throw them out. “ They have a nurse who works hand-in-hand with them. In one of the cases, one of the girls fainted and they rushed her to the nurse. In Favour’s case, some occupants of the building said they saw when they rushed her to one nurse who could not treat her. They took her to a second nurse who confirmed her dead.
