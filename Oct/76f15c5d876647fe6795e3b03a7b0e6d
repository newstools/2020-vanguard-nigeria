The house at its Thursday plenary presided over by the Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Abdullahi Askira, said members of defunct FSARS in Borno under the leadership of Mohammed played vital role in the fight against insurgency and other violent crimes.  Leader of the House, Alhaji Dige Mohammed, who read the Mohammed’s citation, recalled how he raided and repelled the insurgents’ attacks in some local government areas.  “On 21st of July 2020, the team had another encounter with the insurgents in large numbers at Mainok in Kaga LGA, after a fierce battle, dislodged the insurgents and recovered two gun trucks.  “On 13 July 2020, another encounter ensued with Boko Haram who ambushed motorists along Auno -Jakana- Damaturu highway and recovered two anti aircraft guns with four spare barrels, one machine gun with 251 ammunitions, eight AK 47 and two magazines.  “On 14th July 2020, SARS rescued two soldiers abducted by Boko Haram fighters along Maiduguri-Damaturu road and recovered several arms abandoned by the terrorists,” the house leader said.  Reacting, Mohammed lauded the house and the people of Borno for the honour, which he said was a good commendation for the police, particularly members of his team at this critical period of protests.  “I am still a policeman and will continue to discharge my duty in the fight against crime,” Mohammed said.
