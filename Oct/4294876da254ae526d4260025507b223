This is coming after the popular Nolly wood actress took to social media to cry out about her marriage. The Ebonyi state born mother of three shared a video on her Instagram page, revealing she’s tired of her 7 years old marriage to Nollywood director, Austin Faani and wants to move on. Chacha’s brother, Aik Eke, later took to social media to claim her marriage didn’t suffer domestic violence after the news spread like wildfire. She also did a video of herself lying in a hospital bed, claiming she has been diagnosed of bipolar disorder. Many Nigerians rubbished the claim, branded her a liar, and called out her husband for being the mastermind behind the video. Furthermore, Aik Eke took to his Instagram page to blast her husband, Austin, claiming he forced Chacha to do the video in order to save his name.

She is currently being “treated” by Austin’s doctor friend but trust me, she needs to be in a rehab Center. Apparently, she is frustrated whenever she isn’t high on drugs and bears her truth during such moments. I believe she wasn’t high on the day she came on SM to tell the world she is done.
