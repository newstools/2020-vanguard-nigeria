I have spoken to Bisola’s mother to assure her of our support and assistance towards the rescue of her daughter. I have also spoken to the Governor of Rivers, the Attorney General of the State, and the Rivers Police Command to request their assistance in ensuring the safe return of our colleague. “I have also set up a Task Force to collaborate with the relevant authorities and do all that is possible to see to Bisola’s speedy release.
