The concept Narrating how the idea of Best Art Exhibition was conceived, Head of Marketing, Nigerbev, Ololade Olu-Biala said it was a product of the company’s desire to engage their target audience and steer their minds away from the gloom that pervaded 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: “For most of us, at the beginning of the year we had high hopes and quite sure we even went ahead to put down our goals for the year. Ten months into the year, we are all just grateful for being alive with most goals moved to the coming year. After all, only a living person can chase goals and be bothered about achieving them or not. The scenario just mentioned summarizes the current situation around the world with the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s been a period of gloom filled with a lot confusion and so many uncertainties and we wanted an activity with which to engage our target audience… chiefly as a way of easing their mood. Why Art? Arts, especially in the context of Nigeria is always a medium of communication and expression. While always aesthetically pleasing, attention eliciting, something found to be a denominator for many artists and creatives is social consciousness and how that translates very often in the creation of thought-provoking pieces which will elicit a range of emotions among the collectors and art audiences. You’ll see from the pieces on display…. depiction of emotions, lived realities showing resilience, survival and expressions of social consciousness. Particularly in 2020 which has been a very challenging year for the world, expression through arts is one of the ways the creative community is able to communicate and document for posterity, the survival mode we all went into automatically. This initiative birthed by Nigerbev Limited (producers of the Best range of Alcoholic beverages such as cream, whisky, gin and vodka) in partnership with the Prestigious Nike Art Gallery, put this competition together, to give the scores of talented artists across the country a platform to showcase their authentic pieces, and beyond winning prizes, to give them the chance for a wider audience to benefit from their creative geniuses alongside all the benefits that accrues. “Well done and congratulations to all the Artists and those whose works made it to the top 10!!!” Olu-Biala said. “For us at Nigerbev Limited, we believe in self-expression and our objective for this campaign is to celebrate, promote and give support to the amazing artists and creatives that are not yet known in Nigeria.
