The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has threatened to sanction any International Oil Company, IOC engaging the services of unregistered vessels for Cabotage operation in the country. This is even as the apex maritime regulatory agency issued a three-month ultimatum to companies engaged in Cabotage trade in Nigeria to register all vessels used in coastal and inland waters trade. In addition to registration in the applicable Special Register for Cabotage Vessels and Ship Owning companies, and obtaining the Certificate of CabotageRegistration/License, operators with expired registration certificates are to ensure the renewal of their Cabotage Operational Certificate/License for all Cabotage vessels within three months. A statement by Head, Corporate Communications of NIMASA, Phillip Kyanet, noted that at the expiration of the three months, NIMASA would notify relevant government authorities and International Oil Companies (IOCs) to bar vessels without valid Cabotage certificates. Speaking shortly after the Agency released a Marine Notice to announce the decision, Director-General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, disclosed that the notice was part of efforts to ensure strict enforcement of the Coastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Act 2003 and Guidelines on Implementation of the Coastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Act 2003. Jamoh reiterated that the Cabotage Act provided that every vessel intended for use in domestic trade must be duly registered by the Registrar of Ships. The DG stated, “The law provides that every vessel intended for use under the CabotageAct must be duly registered in the appropriate register and the operational certificates be renewed annually. We are out to ensure strict implementation of NIMASA’s mandate under the law. “Ultimately, our intention is to build and continue to enhance the capacity of Nigerians in the shipping industry in line with relevant international regulations.” By Godwin Oritse, Godfrey Bivbere, & Yemie Adeoye LAGOSâ€”THE Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) is to meet with shipping firms over a debt ofÂ  N168.9billionÂ  owed NIMASAÂ  from the three percent freight rate paid on all in and out bound cargoes.
