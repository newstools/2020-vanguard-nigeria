However, a report earlier on Monday from David Ornstein in The Athletic claimed that Arsenal were prepared to meet his release clause. And now journalist Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Partey is ‘flying to London’ to complete a move to the Gunners. He added that the ‘Atletico Madrid board have received the notification 1 hour ago from Arsenal’ for Partey. Arsenal are ‘set to trigger the release clause’ and then it will be a ‘race against time’ to seal the move with Lucas Torreira heading the other way on loan.
