This action followed a curfew imposed by the Lagos State Government, following the violent dimension the protest had assumed in the state. It could however not be ascertained if anyone was killed.  But unconfirmed report said some persons died, while scores were injured. Information received from protesters who managed to flee the scene revealed that the armed security men that fired the shots stormed the venue  unnoticed, switched off the lights before releasing volleys of bullets.

The affected police stations were: Orile, Layeni Amukoko, Mushin, Ilemba Hausa Ilogbo Iyana-era and Ajagbandi divisions , including Cele Police out post under Ijesha division, killing two policemen and injuring many others.
