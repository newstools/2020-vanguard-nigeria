He’s also charged with twice raping another woman at an unnamed Beverly Hills hotel, first in November or December 2009 and again on Nov. 5, 2010, the complaint states. The disgraced producer now faces a total of 11 charges in connection with attacks on five women at Beverly Hills hotels including four counts each of forcible rape and forcible oral copulation, two counts of sexual battery by restraint and one count of sexual penetration by use of force, court papers show.
