An eyewitness who spoke to Vanguard, confirmed the incident saying: “We were having a peaceful match and a couple of people were marching around barracks near stadium and they shot randomly and it hit some guy who apparently wasn’t protesting. Think he was caught up in traffic or something”. “Then while we were trying to figure out the next steps they shot at us again”.

This follows the trend of the Nigerian police cracking down on protesting Nigerian youths.
