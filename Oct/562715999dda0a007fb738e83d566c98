Ally called on religious bodies, community-based organisations, women, and youth groups to support the governor’s initiative rather than engage in vandalisation and looting of property. “The twenty thousand employment opportunities for our youths would obviously have its multiplier effect on the economy therefore the Chairmen of the eighteen local government areas and Civil Service Commission should key into this laudable vision by the governor”.
