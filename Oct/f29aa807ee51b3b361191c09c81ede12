On the party’s campaign, the President said he was encouraged by the large turnout at the grand finale, noting that he had keenly followed events in the State as regards the Governorship election. “I have taken a special interest not necessarily because my party is involved but because my focus and attention have been to ensure that we maximize every given opportunity to raise the bar in our collective desire to deepen democracy,” he said. President Buhari also used the occasion to commend the party’s national and zonal leadership and the APC family in Ondo State for upholding internal democracy and ensuring a hitch-free party primary.
