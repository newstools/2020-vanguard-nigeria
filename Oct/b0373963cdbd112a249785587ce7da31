Hon Agboola Ajayi has explained why he won’t be participating in the debate organized by the channels Television. Ajayi in a statement issued in Akure and personally signed by him said that he would be campaigning in Owo on the day of the debate. “While appreciating the opportunity it offered me to debate with other contenders for the office of governor of Ondo State, I have to let slip-by the offer because I am otherwise engaged. ” l have had my campaign in Owo delayed by a day due to security concerns related to intolerance
and violence. The scheduled event will hold all day on Wednesday while final interaction with my team from across the state would hold in the evening of that same day. ” This is so that I could avail myself of Thursday, October 8th, the last day allowed for campaigns,
to embark on a whistle-stop tour of some locations across the State. Ajayi said ” l hope my decision to maximise the time available for me to continue to dialogue with voters
across the state, a third of who are mostly not able to enjoy debates on national TV because they are not connected to the national grid, will not be seen as taking your offer for granted.
