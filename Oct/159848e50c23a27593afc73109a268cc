In a letter signed on their behalf by Yusuf Yunusa and addressed to the Inspector General of the Police IGP, Mohammed Adamu, the natives said they were frustrated and are on the verge of losing their temper. While they expressed displeasure and anger at the number of deaths recorded in the protests, they complained that countless farm products have gotten spoilt due to road blockages and that daily earners are starved because their customers can no longer reach them. Part of the letter reads: “We the members of the Indigenous People of the FCT wish to express our unreserved displeasure and anger at the blockade of our roads and the disruption of economic activity. “We write to express our offense, our disgust and our anger at the activities of these so called EndSARS protesters and their blockage of roads, tributaries that function for the economic activities of the FCT residents, not to mention the needless loss of lives. “We do not want this, and we reject these continued protests, particularly the form these blockages are taking. Indeed, the laws that make these protests lawful, reserve in the exercise of all vested human rights the fact that where the right of one person ends, the right of another begins. “When the protest started, we members of the Abuja community gave it our support because indeed it was a genuine cause for the abolition of SARS, a unit of the police force that had begun to commit illegal activities against Nigerians. “The government kept its word and listened to the protesters. It is however unfortunate that despite these requests being granted, the protesters have refused to return to their businesses and work. “The freedom of assembly is not permitted to deny others their freedom of movement. That is an infringement and should not be tolerated or accepted by the government or its law enforcement institutions. “We, therefore, call on the Federal Government to enforce the prohibition of these demonstrations and blockages of our roads. “If the protesters must continue with the exercise of their rights, they must do so in such a way that recognizes and upholds the right of movement of other FCT residents.” Vanguard …Protesters now ask for good governance …Candlelight procession for victims …To watch premiership matches on screen at Lekki today …Plan Sunday service at same venue tomorrow Four protesters died yesterday and scores of others were critically injured as protests by Nigerian youths against police brutality, tagged #EndSARS, entered day nine… October 17, 2020 In "SARS Update" …Armed thugs attack protesters in Abuja, Lagos …Sanwo-Olu appeals, says govts currently addressing demands …#EndSARS protest, reflection of leadership failure - Okowa …Motorists, commuters stranded, lament as protests trigger traffic gridlocks …#NotoSWAT protests rock Warri …Awkuzu SARS under lock as protesters paralyze Awka …Police have killed 10 #EndSARS protesters –… October 15, 2020 In "News" ...Ask, FG to stop Army's planned Operation Crocodile Smile …Kill protesters, face International Criminal Court, ASCAB cautions Buratai …Says it’s ill-timed, could exacerbate citizens’ distrust, lack of confidence in state institutions …‘Crocodile Smile’ not going after #EndSARS protesters, says Army …Defence Minister warns protesters against undermining national security …Thugs attacked… October 19, 2020 In "SARS Update"
