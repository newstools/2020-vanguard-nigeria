A statement personally signed by the Chairman, Rep. Nnolim Nnaji(PDP-Enugu), said the “the postponement was necessitated by the continued #EndSARS protests which have remained unabated”. He also cited “the logistics concerns raised by most of the stakeholders expected to attend the public hearing as part of the reasons for the decision to put the programme on hold”. Nnaji disclosed that he had “been inundated with telephone calls all day by stakeholders claiming that they had been unable to access the Lagos Airport to catch their flights to Abuja. “We regret the inconveniences this sudden shift might have caused every interested party” .Honourable  Nnaji said.
The public hearing on the six executive Bills were earlier scheduled to commence on Tuesday October 20 to 22, 2020 at House wing of the National Assembly Complex, Abuja”. He, however, said, “a new date will be announced soon”.
