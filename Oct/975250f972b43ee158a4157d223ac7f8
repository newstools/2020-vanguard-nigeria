They were joined by truck drivers who were caught up in the gridlock and othe motorists who could not make it to the mosque. The protesters arrived Olaiya junction in their numbers around 10am to continue their daily routine which was disrupted on Thursday by hoodlums, who attacked the protesters. The Osun Coordinator of RevolutionNow movement, Olawale Bakare, while addressing journalists said they were well prepared for the hoodlums who attacked the peaceful protesters yesterday, adding that their attempt to hijack the protest would not succeed. He added that their demand is to overhaul the Nigeria Police and not replace SARS with SWAT without proper reform of the security outfit. To curb unexpected attacks, the protesters blocked the Odi-Olowo Olaiya road, Old-Garage to Olaiya and Okefia to Olaiya junction as well. Businesses were paralysed as shop owners around Olaiya junction could not displayed their wares as some of the protesters were unruly and we’re harassing shop owners a the area.
