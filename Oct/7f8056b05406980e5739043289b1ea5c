However, it gladdens my heart that our empowerment and mentorship work which cuts across most of the 19 northern states, has been recognised by these four groups. “As I always like to say: ‘once you have been recognised, it is not time to stop. Instead, it is time to put your foot on the gas and drive forward at full steam.

We have created this platform to not only give back but to also help to prepare the next generation of Nigerian leaders,” Ahmed said.
