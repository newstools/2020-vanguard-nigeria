The independent afrobeat artist from Lagos, Nigeria (based in Houston, Texas) has just shared the new track and it’s available to listen to on all streaming platforms. The upbeat track showcases Cliffbado’s sound and ability as an afrobeat artist. The track can be described as infectious and immediately engaging. The rhythm of “JOJO” is layered and relentless. It’s fast enough for a fast wine and serves as a great introduction to what Cliffbado is capable of. His current sound is heavily influenced by his childhood and living in Lagos. Cliffbado did an interview recently where he talked about his inspirations behind creating music. Since I was a kid I had the rhythm on me but after my high school education I decided to pursue music. Yes, in the extents that when I was living in Lagos the struggle I went through as a kid and now remembering those paths make me want to push myself more to success. And also when people can relate to it with my sound of music. My sound is Afrobeats or as our young generation will call it Afro-Pop. It’s a mixture of African sounds. When I was a little kid as my parents would say when music is being played, I always moved with the rhythm and danced to it, so I’m not surprised when I followed a friend to the studio one day, I fell I love with it and never stopped going to the studio. Generally, I love good sounds, and I get inspired by people around me and my mood at that moment. I play soccer and I also play musical instruments. The likes of Davido, Wizkid, D’banj, Phyno, Meek Mill, and Olamide. Right now, I’m promoting my new single called ”JOJO” is about a beautiful girl I’m trying to date and I’m telling her not to leave me hanging in the real one for her. I’m currently working on an EP right now titled Eyes On The Boy, it’s set to be released this year but haven’t picked a specific date yet. Hope they can see how easy-going life is and try to stay away from trouble and work hard and enjoy life because it’s only those who live today lives to see tomorrow.
