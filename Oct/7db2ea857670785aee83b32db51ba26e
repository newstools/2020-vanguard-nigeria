SNG is first in Nigeria to introduce the technical solution for reinjection of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) through its pipeline network, enabling injection of odours into natural gas to ease detection in case of leak. Aba City Gate plant complements SNG’s recently completed 20km domestic gas pipeline expansion project in Abia, connecting Agbor Hill, Osisioma and Ariaria industrial zones. The expansion project has enabled supply of pipeline gas to Ariaria Market Energy Solutions Limited, the Independent Power Project (IPP) consortium that provides electricity to popular Ariaria market in Abia State.
