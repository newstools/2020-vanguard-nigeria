Reacting through his facebook handle, Jonathan opined: “Dear Honourable Aminu Shagari, Thank you for your apology. However, I never took offence. My firm belief is that I am a pencil in the Hand of God. Therefore, I have no enemies to fight, because of my confidence that people can only do to me what God permits.
