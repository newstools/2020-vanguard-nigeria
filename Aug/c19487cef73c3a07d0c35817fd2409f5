According to him, NMA is driven by its vision to foster effective and efficient healthcare delivery to the public as well as promote  high ethical standard among its members. “The association is willing to collaborate with government agencies that engage in programmes and policies geared towards delivery of standard, quality and non-compromising healthcare services. “NMA will continue to work assiduously to ensure that quality healthcare service is delivered to the good people of Abia,” Okwuonu said.

He expressed delight over the robust relationship that existed between NMA and government, especially in the execution of its various programmes in tackling COVID-19 in Abia. He lauded government’s decision to honor some NMA’s members in the frontline of the fight against COVID-19 during the 29th anniversary of the state’s creation.
