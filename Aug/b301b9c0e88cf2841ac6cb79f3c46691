Human right lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN in a letter to the Chairman, Technical Committee, Conference Planning Committee, Nigerian Bar Association, Professor Konyinsola Ajayi SAN, also called on the association to remove el-Rufai’s name on the list of speakers for the event over the Southern Kaduna crisis. Mr Falana reminded the committee that a similar decision was taken back in 2016 when lawyers were mobilised to boycot all courts in the country to protest the disobedience of court orders by some officials and agencies of the Federal Government and the administration of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) under the leadership of el-Rufai. He had also pleaded with the committee not to give its platform to someone who has a penchant for promoting impunity. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1446366" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM.jpeg?resize=233%2C324&#038;ssl=1" alt="Conference: After lawyers' outcry, NBA withdraws el-Rufai's invite as speaker" width="233" height="324" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM.jpeg?resize=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM.jpeg?resize=42%2C58&amp;ssl=1 42w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM.jpeg?resize=140%2C194&amp;ssl=1 140w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM.jpeg?resize=94%2C130&amp;ssl=1 94w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM.jpeg?w=632&amp;ssl=1 632w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1446365" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM-1.jpeg?resize=239%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="Conference: After lawyers' outcry, NBA withdraws el-Rufai's invite as speaker" width="239" height="332" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM-1.jpeg?resize=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM-1.jpeg?resize=42%2C58&amp;ssl=1 42w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM-1.jpeg?resize=140%2C194&amp;ssl=1 140w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM-1.jpeg?resize=94%2C130&amp;ssl=1 94w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-20-at-6.40.24-PM-1.jpeg?w=632&amp;ssl=1 632w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The conference which is expected to commence from 26th through 29th August 2020 was planned to be held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
