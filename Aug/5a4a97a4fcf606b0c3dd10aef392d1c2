Members of both gangs hijack the opportunity to dispossess passers-by of their valuables and loot residents shops. But I have never joined them to loot or attack innocent persons. Rather, I prevented members from attacking those I know. Sometimes, I returned their stolen items. I only fought because it gives me pleasure to fight”, he said.
