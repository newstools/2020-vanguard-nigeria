In a statement he signed, the activist alleged that at 7p.m. on August 18, on his way home, he was waylaid by a Toyota Camry driven by a fierce-looking person with about two other armed occupants, who trailed him for nearly 30 minutes. He said they made attempts to hit his car from behind, but fortunately, he(Onwubiko) escaped, as the men fled on sighting a police van close by. He noted that the attack is coming a week after HURIWA alleged corruption in the school feeding programmes of the Federal Government.
