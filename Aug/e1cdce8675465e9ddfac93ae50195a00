Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Aaron Mooy has agreed to join Chinese Super League Shanghai SIPG for an undisclosed fee, subject to international clearance. The Australia international only signed a permanent deal with Brighton in January after making an initial loan move from Championship side Huddersfield Town. Brighton on Friday announced that the 29-year-old is on the move again, ending a short spell with the Premier League club. Seagulls head coach Graham Potter said: “Aaron has been an excellent professional during his time with us. From day one with us he fitted in really well. “It’s a good move for all parties. We have a number of really good players in that position and therefore Aaron goes with our blessing. “I have really enjoyed working with him, and on behalf of everyone at the club I would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him well for the future.” Mooy made 32 appearances for Brighton last season, scoring twice and providing two assists.
