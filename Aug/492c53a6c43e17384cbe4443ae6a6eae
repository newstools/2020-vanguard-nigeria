Nehikhare in a statement on Sunday in Benin said that in the last 24 hours, there had been a “diabolical” post on social media suggesting that he had resigned.

I remain in PDP that is enjoying unprecedented support from Edo people and Nigerians. “I remain in PDP to help Gov. Godwin Obaseki continue with his excellent job,” he stated.
