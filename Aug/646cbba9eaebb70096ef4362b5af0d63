Paulo Dybala tweeted out his appreciation for Maurizio Sarri the day after the Italian coach was sacked by Juventus. The Serie A champions decided to take swift action following Friday’s Champions League exit to Lyon, announcing the end of Sarri’s reign less than 24 hours after the second leg of the last-16 tie. Juve did not wait long to name his replacement either, giving the job to Andrea Pirlo just over a week after appointing the former Italy international as their new under-23 team coach. The internal promotion came as a surprise too, considering links to former Juve player and current Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, ex-Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and Simone Inzaghi, who is in charge of domestic rivals Lazio. Reacting to the departure of Sarri, Dybala published a picture on Twitter of the pair together with the comment: “Thank you so much for everything Mister!” Argentina international Dybala enjoyed an excellent 2019-20 season under the former Napoli and Chelsea boss, scoring 11 goals and providing six assists in the league as the Bianconeri finished top of the table for a ninth successive year. Dybala – who was linked with a move away from Turin last year, including to Manchester United – was named Serie A MVP for his performances in domestic games, including Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana games.
