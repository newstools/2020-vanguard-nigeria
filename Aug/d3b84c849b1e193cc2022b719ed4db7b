In our first year we saved over $350, 000 compared to our competitors. This year alone, we’ve saved at least a billion Naira. Our customer account is over 100, 000 and we are all on Android and iOS. In our first year we did more than what they did in their first year. “We’ve not had any fund raised but before the Coronavirus, we planned on starting a fund-raising but with the whole outbreak, everything has been slowed down. “We have introduced pidgin language on our app where users will have options to choose either English or Pidgin English.
