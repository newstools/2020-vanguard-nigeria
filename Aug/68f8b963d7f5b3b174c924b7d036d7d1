The 23-year-old signed for West Ham from Basel in 2019 but managed just nine Premier League appearances last term – none of which were starts. Ajeti has now left London Stadium without a goal to his name in any competition, with the Switzerland international joining Scottish champions Celtic. Although the fee is undisclosed, media reports suggest it is £4.5million, almost half what West Ham paid for him a year ago. He links up with his former Basel team-mate Mohamed Elyounoussi, who is spending a second season loan at Celtic from Southampton. “We are delighted to bring Albian to Celtic. He is a tremendous player, an international with real quality and I know he is really determined to do all he can to bring more success to our supporters,” Neil Lennon said. “I have admired him for long time as he is a really intelligent footballer, well balanced and a really good finisher. We are so pleased to make him a Celtic player and we hope he has a long and prosperous career with us.” Fotmob Vanguard  West Ham crashed out of the FA Cup as their former manager Slaven Bilic led West Brom to a surprise 1-0 win, while Tottenham were held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton in Saturday's fourth-round action.
