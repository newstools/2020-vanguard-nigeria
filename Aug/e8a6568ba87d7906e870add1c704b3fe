Two tropical storms forming in the Gulf Coast could slam parts of the southern US and Texas at the same time next week in what weather experts say could be a first occurrence in more than a century. One of the systems, Tropical Storm Laura, is currently moving through the Caribbean while Tropical Storm Marco is edging into the Gulf Coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. If both storms survive the weekend, Laura could slam the central Gulf Coast near Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida on Wednesday, according to predictions. Marco is headed toward Texas where it is expected to make landfall as a tropical storm. Two hurricanes have never appeared in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time, according to records going back to at least 1900, Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach told the Daily Mail. The last time two tropical storms were in the Gulf together was in 1959, he said. Although it’s not unusual for two storms to hit different parts of the Atlantic Ocean at once, it is extremely rare for two storms or hurricanes to make landfall at the same time, according to the Weather Channel.
