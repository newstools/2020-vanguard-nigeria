Speaking to Vanguard Pastor Anthony said: “let me tell you this, it is the father and the mother of the girl that took me to their house to stay with them even when I did not want to stay with them.

Take this from me I never touched the girl that is the truth.” According to the police, “On 13/07/2020, one Pastor Joseph Anthony ‘m’ of Living Faith Church of Njaba was arrested for the defilement of one Favour Chikanma age 11yrs; the daughter of his fellow pastor, one Pastor Chukwuma Okoronkwo. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the said Pastor Chukwuma Okoronkwo accommodated Pastor Joseph Anthony in their house . “The said Pastor Joseph Anthony took advantage of the fact that he was at home alone with the victim and had canal knowledge of her.
