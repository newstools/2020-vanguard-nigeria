For us in the APC, it is one person, one vote. “Our people-focused development records are visible to all and the good people of Edo state are poised to make the right and progressive choice, come September 19. “We reiterate that our security services must do everything to stop the PDP’s plan to unleash violence, intimidate voters, and buy votes during the election. Come September 19, votes will count and the will of the Edo electorate will prevail”. PDP had accused the APC and its immediate-past National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole of mounting pressure on the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC to procure extra result sheets with the intent of rigging the polls.
