Responding, Badaru thanked the party leadership for giving the committee members opportunity to serve the party, saying that the committee would make aggrieved members to see the need for the reconciliation. “Strengthening and making the party strong is more important than individual interest and I’m sure they will see that and they will agree to come to table and resolve all differences. “And then we will have one single party that is committed and dedicated to fight for the people and continue to help people of Imo and Ogun States,” he said. According to him, the present management of the party is very sincere in the development of the party. “Once, you are sincere, honest and straight forward, you fear nothing.
