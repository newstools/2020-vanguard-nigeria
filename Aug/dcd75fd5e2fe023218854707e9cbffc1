Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is unarguably one of the most influential research centres in the world, and an important international centre for molecular genetics, where over 600 scientists conduct groundbreaking research in cancer, neurobiology, plant genetics, and bioinformatics. Established in 1890, CSHL is recognized internationally for its educational activities, including an extensive programme of scientific meetings and courses that attracts more than 9,000 scientists to the campus each year. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1450020" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultra-modern-DNA-Learning-Centre-in-Nigeria2.jpg?resize=640%2C888&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="888" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultra-modern-DNA-Learning-Centre-in-Nigeria2.jpg?w=738&amp;ssl=1 738w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultra-modern-DNA-Learning-Centre-in-Nigeria2.jpg?resize=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultra-modern-DNA-Learning-Centre-in-Nigeria2.jpg?resize=42%2C58&amp;ssl=1 42w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultra-modern-DNA-Learning-Centre-in-Nigeria2.jpg?resize=140%2C194&amp;ssl=1 140w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultra-modern-DNA-Learning-Centre-in-Nigeria2.jpg?resize=94%2C130&amp;ssl=1 94w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The establishment of DNA Learning Centre DNALC in Nigeria at Godfrey Okoye University is a confirmation of the resolve of the VC, Rev. Fr. Prof. Christian Anieke, to redefine the essence of quality education especially in the areas of Biotechnology and Agricultural Science. It is also another step in the fruitful collaboration that has been cultivated between the DNALC @ CSHL and Godfrey Okoye University to pioneer a shift from usual theoretical teaching of modern biology to hands-on and enquiry-based learning. The Centre was conceived through a collaboration led by an erudite US-based Professor George Ude (a visiting professor of Godfrey Okoye University) as well as Professor of Bowie State University, Dr. Dave Micklos of the DNALC NY, CSHL and Rev. Fr. Professor Christian Anieke, the Vice Chancellor of Godfrey Okoye University, Enugu. It is the first hands-on teaching centre of its kind in Africa.

The experience in the Centre will improve their
confidence and encourage them to take more science classes
and join the STEM workforce. The classes will help them to acquire basic research skills needed to excel in undergraduate and graduate levels. INFORMATION REGARDING THE 2020/21 ACADEMIC SESSION The university has confirmed that the 2020/21 academic session will start on 5 October, 2020. The management of Godfrey Okoye University is working tirelessly to provide as much face-to-face teaching as possible as well as online teaching and learning.
