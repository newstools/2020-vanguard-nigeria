 HUAWEI Y6p offers super long battery life that lets you stay connected Huawei has recently launched their high quality entry-level HUAWEI Y6p. Holding the phone for the first time in either Phantom Purple, Emerald Green or Midnight Black, you’d find it hard to believe that it’s a budget phone. The HUAWEI Y6p not only has a triple rear camera, but one of its most attractive features is its sizable 5000mAh battery within its sleek size – a step up from the 4000mAh in many other models. With HUAWEI Y6p’s powerful battery, you won’t have to worry about charging your phone frequently. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1448348" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei1.jpg?resize=640%2C415&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="415" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei1.jpg?resize=300%2C195&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei1.jpg?resize=768%2C498&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei1.jpg?resize=58%2C38&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei1.jpg?resize=260%2C169&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei1.jpg?resize=200%2C130&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> A battery upgrade for the 129 USD smartphones allowing for care-free travelling You essentially have your phone on you every day – but will your smartphone’s battery life suffice? Battery life is an important consideration for people who have to travel often or have to commute to work. The new HUAWEI Y6p is the model with biggest battery capacity within the HUAWEI Y Series. After a single full charge, it can support up to 32 hours of video playback or up to 20 hours of continuous 4G surfing, giving a much needed boost to battery life for your daily needs. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1448351" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei2.jpg?resize=640%2C393&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="393" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei2.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei2.jpg?resize=768%2C472&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei2.jpg?resize=58%2C36&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei2.jpg?resize=260%2C160&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei2.jpg?resize=200%2C123&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Thanks to Huawei’s EMUI10.1 OS, HUAWEI Y6p also features an Ultra Power Saving Mode that helps extend battery life. When it is running out of battery, the user just needs to turn on this mode under the battery settings. With this, the smartphone immediately shuts down low-priority apps to leave only the Call, Text, Contact and some selected apps working, which effectively extends the battery life for users. Users can also go to this mode and check the remaining battery time. With such impressive battery life, users can rest assured that they can stay online and connected with family and friends when travelling or commuting. Some may even joke that HUAWEI Y6p is as powerful as a power bank. And in fact, the smartphone can be used as a power bank for other devices! It supports reverse charging that can make full use of its big battery. Just use an OTG cable to connect HUAWEI Y6p with another device that needs recharging and the smartphone can quickly charge the device or accessory, such as headphones. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1448353" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?resize=640%2C431&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?resize=768%2C518&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?resize=58%2C39&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?resize=260%2C175&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?resize=193%2C130&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/huawei3.jpg?resize=115%2C77&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Long standby time for superior video and audio experience With a longer standby time, users can freely enjoy mobile games, music or videos on their smartphone for the entire day. HUAWEI Y6p features a 6.3-inch LCD display with narrow bezels and a minimal dewdrop cut-out area for a wider viewing experience. In terms of audio effects for video playback, HUAWEI Y6p supports the 10V high voltage Smart PA technology, enabling a maximum speaker volume of 88dB, which is about 1.6 times that of a normal smartphone.
