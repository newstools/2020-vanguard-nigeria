The State Publicity Secretary of the APC for APC, Alex Kalejaiye, said he could not ascertain the particular political party that masterminded the attack in Ilaje. “I cannot mention the group that attacked our supporters in Ilaje, but what I know is that we do not support violence in the process,” “I hope this is not a prelude to the coming governorship election and we are calling on the security agencies to take charge and fish out the perpetrators.” Also reacting on behalf of the ADC, its governorship Candidate, Prince Adedapo Adelegan in a statement said,“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this vicious attack on electorates at this critical time in Ondo State. It is against humanity to deny people from expressing their rights to promote their party and preferred candidate for an office. “This attack on Ondo State electorates, no matter which party they belong, is highly unacceptable under any circumstances. Therefore, I appeal to party leaders of all contesting parties in Ondo State to call their members to order and allow peace to reign. “I also appeal to the Executive Governor Akeredolu as the Chief Security Officer of our State, to ensure the reign of peace and tranquillity at this period.” Adelegan added that “the Africa Democratic Congress offers it deepest condolences to all the families and communities affected by these senseless acts and calls for greater effort to protect citizens and electorates for the Chairman and counsellor election process tomorrow and the upcoming Governorship election in October Contacted the state police command spokesperson, Tee Leo-Ikoro confirmed the clashes adding that many people were injured in the ugly incident.
