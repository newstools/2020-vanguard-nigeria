Organisers of the conference had lined up 10 speakers among who are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State;  Nyesom Wike; Speaker of the  House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; former President Olusegun Obasanjo; former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, and Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad, among others, for the event. In a statement by its Chairman, Mr. Adesina Ogunlana and its Secretary, Ayo Ademiluyi, RAMINBA noted that: “We are baffled that the list of speakers at the conference still retains the names of  Olusegun Obasanjo, a retired General and former President, as well as that of Mr. Nyesom Wike, the Governor of Rivers State. “We are persuaded that these men by their antecedents vis-a-vis the respect for and promotion for the rule of law and due process are not fit for invitation as speakers in a function such as the conference of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, which mantra remains to promote the rule of law. “We also hold that using them as speakers on the platform of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, is a huge disservice to the original intendment and core purpose of the Association itself, particularly as regards the campaign for supremacy of the concept of the rule of law and the sanctity of judicial pronouncements. “Governor Wike is a member of the legal profession. As a matter of fact, he is a Life Bencher. That in itself places a higher responsibility on him to promote and uphold the rule of law. “We submit that retaining invitations of former Obasanjo and Governor Wike when Governor El-Rufai’s invitation was withdrawn, is neither right nor consistent. “Such retention will certainly present the NBA as a hypocritical association with double standards.” VANGUARD By David Royal With nine days to the 60th annual Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Conference, some lawyers on social media have queried the inclusion of Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai as one of the key speakers in the forthcoming virtual conference NBA had on May 12, 2020, stated that it… August 19, 2020 In "News" By Evelyn Usman President—elect of  Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Olumide Akpata, has charged Nigerians to begin to hold leaders at all levels of governance accountable by asking questions bothering on the sustainable development of Nigeria, if the desired transformational change must be achieved.
