It was a horrible experience but it turned out to be one of my best but giving up every other thing to pursue this career has been my biggest sacrifice. Yes, acting is lucrative, and it pays my bill so far. And another experience I can’t forget is playing the role of a tomboy, it is totally outside my natural characteristics,” she said. According to her, her high point so far remains the day she received an award for one of her films in the ‘Most Promising Actress’ category of BON AWARDS 2017. She has only produced one film of her own “My Beautiful” but featured in over 20 films.
