Abdulkareem, who stated this on Monday while speaking with newsmen in Ilorin, added  that the Federal Government had yet to give a specific date for institutions of higher learning to reopen. The vice-chancellor said the University of Ilorin would remain closed to students pending the directives of constituted authorities. He, however, said that the university was fully prepared to welcome its students back to campus for the completion of the 2019/2020 academic session and the subsequent new session. The vice-chancellor said that all arrangements were being perfected to ensure that the campus was made safe and conducive for members of the university community. He said that all arrangements were also being perfected toward ensuring that the processes of admitting new students began as stated by the concerned authorities. According to him, the University of Ilorin remains the choice of the greatest number of intending students. Abdulkareem explained that the university was almost completing the total campus internet connectivity, which he said, would facilitate the reception of internet from everywhere on the campus of the university. “The gigantic improvement in internet connectivity across the university campus is being pursued in preparation for the adoption of the new normal way of conducting teaching and learning to minimise contact between lecturers and their students,” he said.
