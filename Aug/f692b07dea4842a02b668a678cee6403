With negative expectations already priced in, company earnings did better than expected, spurring investor interest across Cement and Tier I bank stocks and driving the equity market to gain 0.9 % in the month of July 2020. But analysts have advised investors in the new week to continue to rejig their portfolios by buying shares of companies that post positive earnings as they expect mixed performance in companies’ first half, HI’20, results this week. Reacting to the market performance, analysts at Cordros Capital Limited, said: “Our view continues to favour cautious trading as risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions. Thus, we continue to advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks.” Also reacting, analysts at Cowry Asset stated: “In this new week, we expect investors to continue to rejig their portfolios by buying shares of companies that post positive results and have sound fundamentals. Nevertheless, we advise our clients to trade cautiously as we anticipate mixed H1 2020 corporate earnings performance” Analysts at Vetiva Research in their comment said: “We attribute the positive Week on Week, WoW performance to the significant movement recorded in the Industrial goods sector on Monday due to the better than expected earnings results posted by some companies in the sector.
