Cowell will as a result of the accident sit out the rest of the current season and now the singer who owes her career to the music mogul is joining the show as a judge. According to hollywood.com, Clarkson will join regulars Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Sofia Vergara on Tuesday and Wednesday (August 11-12, 2020) as the show returns. “My friend, Simon Cowell, is doing better now but was in an accident and won’t be able to make Tuesday and Wednesday’s live shows for AGT, but no worries America, someone far wiser, cooler, and hotter is taking his seat! The unbelievably amazing Kelly Clarkson,” Clarkson says. “You’re welcome in advance!” Clarkson will not find herself in an unknown terrain as aside winning the first season of American Idol, she’s also a judge on The Voice.
