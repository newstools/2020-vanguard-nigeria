But US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’s ruling late on Monday wasn’t a total loss for Epic, as she granted the company’s request for a temporary order blocking Apple from limiting the game developer’s ability to provide Unreal Engine, key graphics technology, for other apps. The mixed ruling comes as Apple faces a backlash from some app developers who say its standard App Store fee of 30% and others policies are unfair and designed to benefit the iPhone maker’s own services. The fight blew up on 13 August when Epic told customers it would begin offering a discounted direct purchase plan for items in Fortnite, and Apple then removed the game app, cutting off access for more than a billion iPhone and iPad customers. Apple had no immediate comment on the ruling. Rogers said at a hearing earlier in the day that the case isn’t a “slam dunk” for either side and cautioned that her temporary ruling won’t dictate the final outcome of the litigation. Epic’s Unreal Engine is a suite of software used by developers to build 3D games and other products. Cutting off Epic from Apple’s iOS and Mac developer tools would mean the gaming company can no longer distribute Unreal Engine to other developers, Epic said on Sunday in a legal filing.
