Trouble started when Governor Okowa while campaigning with his Edo State counterpart, urged the people to return Governor Godwin Obaseki for a second term in office to replicate the prosperity for all Deltans in the state and create a synergy between him and the Edo State Governor in the area of roads construction and other developmental ventures. Accusing Governor Okowa of allegedly diverting state funds to fund the governorship election of Obaseki, the APC in a statement by its publicity secretary, Sylvester Imonina, also asked the Edo people not to fall for the prosperity for all Deltans mantra of Governor Okowa stressing that the mantra has since become poverty for all Deltans describing it as a ruse and a mere superficial statement calculated to hoodwink the gullible. Reacting to the claims of the APC, the Delta State PDP publicity secretary, Dr. Ifeanyi Ozuoza described the party as a gathering of confused and unserious jokers who have nothing better to do than bark, like lazy dogs, at everything they see or hear, without reason. He also took a swipe at Mr. Imonina who he said has been brutally exposed as an imposter by what he described as a faction of the APC in the state saying, “Our advice to Sylvester Imonina is to try as much as possible to clear his head of bitterness and confusion, clear his name from the damning allegation of impersonation which his own party has brought on his head and to also try as much as possible to understand what party politics really means.” Apparently angered by the outburst of the PDP spokesperson, Mr. Imonina accused him of lacking character and finesse in public discourse and utterances said: “We want to state that Delta PDP is the one whose name and activities are synonymous with unseriousness and confusion. “Delta PDP on the other hand, an amalgam of political jobbers is known to bully every voice that does not align with the Pharoah. Delta State has been turned to a fiefdom where the Governor’s sense of nepotism smells to high heaven. “While his daughter is an SSA with a budget of over N300million, his wife through her pet project is rolling in millions of Naira, his brothers smiling to banks on a daily basis, Deltans continue to wallow in abject poverty.” VANGUARD Allegations false says Okowa By Ozioruva Aliu – Benin City The crisis and the build-up to the Edo state governorship election got messier on Friday, as the All Progressives Congress (APC) accused the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) aided by Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa of importing arms and… August 21, 2020 In "Politics" THE  All Progressives Congress, APC, has bounced back to reckoning in Delta State with the newest resolution of the former governor of the state, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, to pitch tent with the party, an earth-shattering political judgment that has paradoxically sent the ruling People’s Democratic Party, PDP, in the state… August 25, 2018 In "Politics" Efforts of governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to secure a soft-landing for Governor Godwin Obaseki have hit a brick-wall, if outcome of party leaders’ meeting with Professor Ibrahim Gambari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, are anything to go by.
