Mr. Charles Odili, NDDC Director of Corporate Affairs, said in a statement in Port Harcourt on Monday that the scammers demanded money from unsuspecting Nigerians to obtain jobs. “NDDC is once again compelled to alert members of the public of activities offering placements in non-existent empowerment programmes purportedly being run by the commission. “We have received several inquiries from potential victims, who were deceived into believing that NDDC was currently running different training and skills acquisition programs. “The hapless job-seekers are being asked by scammers to pay some enrollment fees into fake accounts,” he said.
