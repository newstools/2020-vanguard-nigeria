The State’s Commissioner for Education, Sanusi Kiru said this in a statement signed by the ministry’s Public Relationships Officer, Malam Aliyu Yusuf, on Wednesday in Kano. According to him, the attention of parents whose wards are involved in writing the ongoing WAEC Examinations had been drawn to the reality that the Public Holiday does not affect the conduct of their examinations. He further called on the students to go to their respective centres so as to continue with their normal examinations. Kiru also urged the management of the schools selected as examinations centres to continue to observe the COVID-19 protocols, not only among the students but also among themselves.
