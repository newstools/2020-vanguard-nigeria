Alumona also joined the Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Dr. Emeka Onwe-Ogah, and the four doctors that attended to her late daughter. In the suit filed at the Federal High Court Abakaliki, by his he lawyers, C. A. Aiyamekhue & Co, the policeman claimed that the defendants’ alleged medical negligence, malpractice and professional misconduct caused the death of his daughter.

Alumona, therefore, demands one billion Naira from the teaching hospital, as general damages for the “avoidable” death of his daughter, and also asked for the immediate release of her corpse for burial in line with Igbo culture and transition. The suit alleged that the “defendants through their culpable medical negligence, malpractice, professional misconduct and carelessness caused the painful, agonizing and ill-timed death of Miss Rosemary Osinachi Alumona, daughter of the plaintiff” He claimed that an overdose of Mesporine 1000mg through intravenous injection to the six months old Miss Rosemary Osinachi Alumona, without recourse or due regard to her age and body weight was gross medical malpractice and culpable negligence.” In the suit, Alumona accused the doctors of being “incompetent and negligent medical practitioners by prescribing and administering overdosage Mesporine 1000mg to Miss Rosemary Osinachi Alumona without recourse or consideration to her age and body weight which was instrumental to her painful and ill-timed death.” He is, therefore, demanding one billion naira for general damages for the avoidable death of Miss Rosemary Osinachi Alumona “due to gross negligence, medical malpractice and incompetence with its attendant mental, physical and psychological trauma on the plaintiffs”.
