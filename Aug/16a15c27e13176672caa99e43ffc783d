She gave this impression recently on Instagram.

A rapist is a menace to society…” It should be recalled that sometime In April, Halima Abubakar announced the birth of her baby boy on her Instagram handle; however the baby’s picture she used in announcing the arrival of her child belongs to an American mother, who called her out for making use of her child’s photograph without permission.
