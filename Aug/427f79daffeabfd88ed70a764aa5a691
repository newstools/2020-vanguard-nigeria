Modupe who lives at Iyana-Church area in Ibadan, told Chief Ademola Odunade, the court’s President that her husband is trying to kill her to make himself rich. ”He lied to me that he went to school. He has no certificate to show for it. “After my husband had frustrated my efforts to further my education at the University,  I got assistance from friends and I graduated. “He wants to get rich quick and I am his target. I bleed every time I sleep with him. I see sacrificial calabash on my head in my dreams and in the bedroom. “Sometimes when we are in bed, my husband does some magical things at midnight that suggests his evil intention towards me. “When I saw these signs, I abandoned the home to him, but our Pastor intervened and I returned once more. “I eventually packed away, but he traced me about with hired killers who confessed and warned me to be careful,” he said. The respondent, however, opposed the suit and denied all the allegations leveled against him. Aderemi argued that his wife was adulterous who lays about with men. “I did not make any attempt to use Modupe for money ritual. I have also been responding to my children,” Aderemi stated. Delivering judgment, Odunade, dissolved the marriage citing threat to life for the court’s decision. He awarded custody of the four children to the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay N20,000 as their monthly feeding allowance, in addition, to be responsible for their education and other welfare.
