FORMER Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Olabode George, has blasted former governor of Ekiti State, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, for saying that Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State will lose the forthcoming governorship election. Fayose, in an interview on Plustv Africa, had said that despite being a PDP member, he will not support Governor Obaseki’s re-election bid. However, faulting Fayose’s statement, Chief George said the former Ekiti State governor was on his own. George said: “I find it completely unacceptable. How can a committed member who has benefited immensely from the party pitch his tenth against our own candidate in Edo State? “I am countering such remarks by telling the people of Edo State that we, members of the PDP in the South-West, that we are in support of Obaseki. We pray for him and we will work and support him to win the election. “PDP in the South-West and I dissociate ourselves from Fayose’s statement. He is on his own because we do not know where that is coming from.” VANGUARD ... as Bode George, Fayose, others storm Ibadan for meeting By Adeola Badru THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders in the southwest states have unanimously re-strategised to take over the remaining five states being controlled by the All Progressives Congress (APC), just as the party harped on unity to achieve… March 12, 2020 In "Politics" GOVERNOR Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State has expressed doubts over the report by some governors who paid a courtesy visit to the ailing President Muhammadu Buhari in London, saying the was excluded from the team because they knew he would certainly tell Nigerians the correct health status of the President.
