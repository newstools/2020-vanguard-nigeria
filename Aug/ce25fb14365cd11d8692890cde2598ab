Addressing a press conference, Obahiagbon said Obaseki has failed in bringing dividends of democracy to the people of the state. He said the administration has become an automated teller machine to the Peoples Democratic Party. He said, “Matters of governance in Edo state which was the primary ratiocination why the Governor was elected, which in any case have been hereinbefore handled with Olympian aloofness and magisterial pontifications, have now been completely abandoned, jettisoned, and forgotten completely as the outgoing Governor has turned his attention, full-time, on how to subvert the September 19th election through the rigging, intimidation, arm-twisting, unbridled threats, violence, and other anti-democratic underhand tactics.” He also accused the governor of not paying attention to warnings that the state would be affected by torrential rainfalls hence the flooding in parts of the state capital whenever it rains. In his reaction, the Special Adviser to Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie said the Obaseki-led government has a robust governance system in place that is responding to the daily needs of Edo people in all sectors of the state. He said: “The governor is renowned for his best-in-class managerial skills, a fact the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) cannot controvert and has been multi-tasking amid the demands of his reelection campaigns. “Specifically, salaries and pension for Edo workers and pensioners for the month of July 2020, were paid on the 23rd, to enable our Muslim brothers and sisters celebrate the Eid-El-Kabir festival. “The APC continues to reinforce its disadvantage each time it attempts to fault the managerial ability of Governor Godwin Obaseki, because Edo people know that the governor is head and shoulder above Osagie Ize-Iyamu in human and material resources management, and feel secure with Governor Obaseki in charge of governance, especially in the application of our scarce resources.” Vanguard The Chairman of the Edo State All Progressives Congress (APC) Media Campaign Council for the Edo governorship election, Mr. John Mayaki, has said that the incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki and his "redundant MOUs" will be evicted from office by the people of Edo State on the 19th of September.
