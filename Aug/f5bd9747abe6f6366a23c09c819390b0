One Suraju Alabi was reported dead after attacking the palace of Akire, attempting to release a suspect remanded in the palace. It was gathered that the deceased led a gang of hoodlums to the Akire palace around 1 pm and attack members of vigilante attached to the palace in an attempt to release a suspect the team earlier arrested. Although it was not yet clear the reason for arresting the suspect, however, the vigilante resisted the mission and in the process, a fracas ensued leading to disruption of peace and public order around the palace area. Also, both warring factions sustained various degrees of injuries and were taken to different hospitals in the town. However, Suraju, who led the gang to the palace was said to have later died at a private hospital in Apomu, a neighbouring town in Isokan Local Government Council Area of the State.
