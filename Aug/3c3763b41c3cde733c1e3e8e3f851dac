The ministry said in a statement that 1,000 of the detentions were in the capital Minsk and the rest in other parts of the country. It said protesters in Minsk had lit flares, erected barricades, scattered nails and spikes on roads and thrown objects including paving stones at police. Fifty civilians and 39 police officers were injured in clashes in the capital, it said. “Some of the citizens taken to the country’s medical institutions were intoxicated. “No military weapons were used against the perpetrators. There were no fatalities,” the ministry said.
