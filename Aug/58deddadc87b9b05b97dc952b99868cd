Jose Holebas has returned to Olympiakos after five years at Premier League club Watford, the Greek champions announced on Tuesday. The 36-year-old former Greece international, who played for Olympiakos from 2010 to 2014, signed a one-year contract for an undisclosed fee. “Olympiakos made me what I am today,” Holebas said after signing his new deal. German-born Holebas won four Greek Super League titles and two Greek Cups during his first spell at the club based just outside Athens. He left Watford before the end of last season after finding playing time hard to come by.
