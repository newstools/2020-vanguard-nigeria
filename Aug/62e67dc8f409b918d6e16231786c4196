Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez, who have combined for 54 goals this season, lead the line for Inter, while there is still no place in Conte’s starting line-up for Christian Eriksen or Alexis Sanchez. Sevilla are already the most successful side in Europa League history, winning the competition five times since 2006. However, only Jesus Navas and Ever Banega in previous spells at the club have won the Europa League with the Spaniards from Julen Lopetegui’s starting XI. Lopetegui makes his first change in four games of the mini-tournament in northern Germany over the past fortnight as Luuk De Jong is rewarded for scoring the winner against Manchester United in the last four with a start up front ahead of Youssef En-Nesyri.
