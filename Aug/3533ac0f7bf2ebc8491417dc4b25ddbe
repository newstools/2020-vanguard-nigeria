The Country Director for Chastex Consult, Ini Archibong, in a telephone conversation with Vanguard, said: “Shoprite is not leaving Nigeria. “We have only just opened to Nigerian investors which we have also been talking to just before now. We are not leaving, who leaves over a $30billion investment and close shop? It doesn’t sound right. “We only gave this opportunity to Nigeria investors to come in and also help drive our expansion plan in Nigeria. So we are not leaving. “I have tried to say this to many people as I can. There should be no panic at all and all of that. There is no truth in that report.” Recall that reports have been circulating that the retail outlet has started a formal process to consider the potential sale of all or a majority of stake in its supermarkets in Nigeria. The report said the retailer had struggled in the Nigeria market after some South African owned retailer shops exited the Nigeria market. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1435998" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?resize=582%2C777&#038;ssl=1" alt="Shoprite debunks exit rumour, says we are not leaving Nigeria" width="582" height="777" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?resize=767%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 767w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?resize=768%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?resize=43%2C58&amp;ssl=1 43w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?resize=145%2C194&amp;ssl=1 145w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?resize=97%2C130&amp;ssl=1 97w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-03-at-1.45.49-PM.jpeg?w=809&amp;ssl=1 809w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The report further stated that Shoprite results for the year do not reflect any of their operations in Nigeria as it will be classified as a discontinued operation.
