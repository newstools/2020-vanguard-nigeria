The increase in M2 was propelled by a 18.14 percent  rise in Narrow Money (M1) to N12.20 trillion (of which Demand Deposits increased by 21.69 percent  to N10.31 trillion, and currency outside banks, rose by 1.92 percent  to N1.89 trillion), and accompanied by a 6.27 percent  rise in Quasi Money (near maturing short term financial instruments) to N19.97 trillion.
