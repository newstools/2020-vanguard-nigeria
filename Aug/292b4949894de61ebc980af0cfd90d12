The Corriere Dello Sport did some digging and worked out the ‘real’ cost of the operation is actually closer to €47.5m – and even that can be paid over five years.

Again, there are a further €10m in performance-related bonuses, also extremely difficult to achieve, for instance winning the Ballon d’Or. A massive €20m is calculated by sending goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis – third choice at Napoli – and three youth team players to Lille, valuing them all at €5m each.
