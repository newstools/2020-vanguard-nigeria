In the said publication, it was stated that “Uduaghan was linked to the emergency repairs of Close B, Alhaji Estate & Environs, Rumuodomaya, Port Harcourt at a cost of N429m.” Uduaghan in a statement on Monday by his Media Assistant, Monoyo Edon, stated very clearly that the said accusation is false. The statement read ”Dr. Uduaghan has never approached the NDDC for any contract whatsoever. It is even more ridiculous that the said contract is a road inside Port Harcourt town. ”Dr. Uduaghan has drawn the attention of the Hon. Minister of the Niger Delta, Sen Godswill Akpabio to the publication and hopes he makes a correction. ”Members of the public are advised to disregard the mischievous publication” Vanguard News Nigeria GOVERNOR Emmanuel Uduaghan of Delta state has emerged the new Chairman Forum of governors of member states of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.
