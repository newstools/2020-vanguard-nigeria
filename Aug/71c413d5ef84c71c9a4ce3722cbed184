While some have settled for simple short skits, Moshood Fattah (Fishbone, Man Enough) and AfricaMagic #UNBRETHREN star Mike Afolarin are set to take the trend to another level with their short movie AARGH! The comedy short revolves around two discordant friends who frustrated by Nigeria’s current political scene stumble on an idea that could change the country for the better.
