The results of Phase I/II trial published on the 20th of July 2020 in the scientific journal, The Lancet, indicate no early safety concerns even as it induces strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system. According to the report, the vaccine provoked a T cell response within 14 days of vaccination (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus), and an antibody response within 28 days (antibodies are able to neutralise the virus so that it cannot infect cells when initially contracted). The study showed that participants who received the vaccine had detectable neutralising antibodies, which have been suggested by researchers as important for protection and these responses were strongest after a booster dose, with 100 per cent of participants’ blood having neutralising activity against the coronavirus. The next step in studying the vaccine is to confirm that it can effectively protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to one of the researchers,  Professor  Pollard: “We saw the strongest immune response in the 10 participants who received two doses of the vaccine, indicating that this might be a good strategy for vaccination,” A UK Phase I/II trial began in April testing the Oxford coronavirus vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The team started working to develop a vaccine against the global threat that is coronavirus in January 2020 and have been working with unprecedented urgency in a race against the coronavirus. During the Phase I/II trial the vaccine has been evaluated in more than 1,000 healthy adult volunteers aged between 18 and 55 years in a randomised controlled trial. A subset of these volunteers (10 people) received two doses of the vaccine. Between April 23, 2020, and May 21, 2020, 1077 volunteers, received the vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a placebo MenACWY vaccine. There were no serious adverse health events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The University of Oxford is working with the UK-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for further development, large-scale manufacture, and potential distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine, with plans for clinical development and production of the Oxford vaccine progressing globally. The project has been further spurred by £84 million of Government funding to help accelerate the vaccine’s development. Commenting, the Executive Vice President of BioPharmaceuticals Research and Development at AstraZeneca, Mene Pangalos said:  “We are encouraged by the Phase I/II interim data showing AZD1222 was capable of generating a rapid antibody and T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2. While there is more work to be done, today’s data increases our confidence that the vaccine will work and allows us to continue our plans to manufacture the vaccine at scale for broad and equitable access around the world.” Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the results are extremely encouraging and that would take them one step closer to finding a successful vaccine to protect millions in the UK and across the world. “Backed by £84 million Government investment for the vaccine’s development and manufacture, the agility and speed with which the University of Oxford has been working is outstanding. I am very proud of what they have achieved so far.” Speaking, Chair of the UK’s Vaccine Taskforce, Kate Bingham stated that;“The UK is fortunate to have such outstanding academic innovators working alongside the highly experienced global team at AstraZeneca. This partnership is working at exceptional speed to demonstrate the safety and clinical effectiveness of the chadox vaccine in protecting people against COVID-19 infection.” Vanguard Italian researchers have revealed plans to test a vaccine on humans after claiming their jab is the 'first in the world' to neutralise the virus. According to Daily Mail, scientists gave mice the jab - which is being developed by Rome-based Takis Biotech - and took the antibodies they made… May 7, 2020 In "Coronavirus Updates" A team of US scientists jostled for a view of the lab dish, staring impatiently for the first clue that an experimental vaccine against the new coronavirus just might work. After weeks of round-the-clock research at the National Institutes of Health, it was time for a key test. If the vaccine… March 8, 2020 In "Coronavirus Updates" Oxford University is launching a human trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine, with the daunting aim of making a successful jab available to the public later this year. Of the more than 100 research projects around the world to find a vaccine -- described by the United Nations as the… April 23, 2020 In "Coronavirus Updates"
