According to SPA, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has ordered an extension of the government “initiatives” for an unspecified additional period. “This move builds on urgent government measures that support individuals, investors and private businesses; as well as alleviate financial and economic consequences of the novel coronavirus,” it said.
