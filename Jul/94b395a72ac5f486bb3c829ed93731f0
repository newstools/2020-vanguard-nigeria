These movie theatres should reopen on the premise that proper prevention and control measures have been put in place, the administration said in a circular. Attendance per show must not exceed 30 per cent, according to a guideline on the sector’s work resumption issued by the Chinese Film Circulation and Projection Association on Thursday. Cinemas are required to sell non-adjacent tickets in every other row, and moviegoers who are strangers to each other should keep a distance of at least one metre. All moviegoers must make real-name reservations and purchase tickets online. Those who do not wear masks or with a body temperature above 37.3 degrees Celsius will not be admitted into the theatres, the guideline read.
