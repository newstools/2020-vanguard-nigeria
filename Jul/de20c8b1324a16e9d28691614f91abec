Prof Pondei, who is the managing director of the agency’s Interim Management Committee (IMC), collapsed while he was being grilled by the panel over allegations bordering on the mismanagement of funds. Speaking after Prof Pondei was taken to a hospital after he fainted at the probe venue, Gbajabiamila directed the panel to use documents he already tendered to the panel to reach its conclusion. He said: “We wish him well. I have been here barely five minutes and I am already sweating profusely. So, I do understand and apologise to everybody here for the poorly conducive atmosphere. I want to say at this point and make it clear, that it is not an adversarial hearing. It is not even inquisitorial. “It is a fact-finding mission for the people of Nigeria. Just to make things better and we should handle this as such. No one is under an inquisition. The fact must come out and that is why the committee is doing what it is doing. “Because of these conditions in this hall, we don’t need to hear further from the acting MD because he has already submitted his written report. I think you can use the documents to do the work that needs to be done. “Starting from the minister, Dr. Cairo Ojougbo and all the executive directors – we are sorry under the conditions which you have been invited and my members are under the same conditions. We wish Mr. Pondei all the best.” Vanguard Akpabio hails decision, accuses lawmakers of benefitting from contracts Says NDDC opened 300 accounts, awarded over N1.3trillion fraudulent projects Agency's Boss, Pondei collapses, as Gbajabiamila details doctors to revive him By Tordue Salem - Abuja A medley of drama and theatrics marked the ongoing House of Representatives Committee on the… July 20, 2020 In "News" THE on going investigative hearing of the House of Representatives’ Ad-hoc Committee into the activities of Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, was yesterday full of drama.
