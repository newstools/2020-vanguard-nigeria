It was an essential result after Leicester’s 4-1 thrashing by lowly Bournemouth on Sunday. Leicester remain in fourth place, just one point behind third-placed Chelsea and three ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United, who face Crystal Palace later on Thursday. The Foxes face a tense run-in as they bid to return to the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17. Their next match is at Tottenham on Sunday before a potentially decisive home clash with Manchester United on the last day of the season. Sheffield United’s first defeat in five games was a blow to their hopes of reaching the Europa League at the climax of a fine first season back in the top-flight. Aged 19 years, 36 days, academy graduate Luke Thomas was the third youngest player to make his first Premier League start for Leicester after Emile Heskey and Stuart Campbell. The England Under-19 left-back laid on an early chance for Perez when his cross was headed over by the Leicester winger. Jamie Vardy forced Dean Henderson to save with his legs and the Blades keeper had to be alert again moments later to deny Perez’s volley from another Thomas cross. It was third time lucky for Perez as the Spaniard put Leicester ahead in the 29th minute with his first goal since January. Perez started the attack with a pass wide to Thomas and took the return ball before drilling low past Henderson from just inside the penalty area. Vardy hit the post from Youri Tielemens’ defence-splitting pass soon after the interval, with Henderson twice tested by Harvey Barnes as Leicester pushed for a second. John Egan’s header forced a fine save from Leicester’s Kasper Schmeichel, but Gray’s deft finish sealed the points from Vardy’s pass in the 79th minute.
