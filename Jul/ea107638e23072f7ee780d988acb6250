The 57-year-old boss was linked with the hot seat at the Catalan giants when Ernesto Valverde was dismissed back in January. Barcelona appointed Quique Setien as manager but he has come under pressure in recent weeks. Koeman, who revealed earlier this month that he turned down offers from Barcelona in January, was seen moving home in the Spanish city this week. ‘I had a call from Barcelona, but I wanted to keep my word and manage the Netherlands in the European Championship,’ he told Catalunya Radio, reported via Marca. ‘I have the possibility to leave after the tournament, but now is not the time to think about that. ‘Everyone knows it’s my dream to manage Barcelona, and I hope to have another chance in the future.’ Setien has come under fire of late and has called for unity at the Nou Camp amid mounting reports that he has lost the confidence of his players. The scrutiny has intensified after Barcelona were held to another draw by Atletico Madrid in LaLiga on Tuesday after Celta Vigo picked up a point against them at the weekend.
