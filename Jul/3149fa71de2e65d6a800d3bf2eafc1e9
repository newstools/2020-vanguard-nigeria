The youths, carrying placards with various inscriptions, expressed their rejection of the indirect mode of primary and imposition of candidates. Speaking at the Oyo State Secretariat of the APC, Oke-Ado, Ibadan where the protest held, the youth groups, under the aegis of APC Youth Vanguards, held placards with some inscriptions. Some of them read: “Oyo wants direct primary in Nigeria and Ondo”; “Oyo wants direct primary elections in APC”, “APC wants direct primary in Ondo”, “APC wants direct primary in all state”, “APC needs Ondo” and “President Buhari, please save APC.” Others read: “Save APC in Ondo”; “We advocate for direct primary in Ondo” and “Direct Primary, no indirect Primary”. “We are here to let our leaders know what we are facing not only in Oyo state but throughout the country concerning the party. We can see what is happening big here and there concerning the primaries and we believe that if there is direct primaries in states where we are having election very soon, like Ondo and Edo state, direct primaries will not give room for godfatherism. “In other words we want the primary elections to be direct primary so that our people can vote for the candidate of their choice and not that they will impose anybody on them, so we believe that our leaders in Oyo state can help us to let the National leaders know what we are facing not only in Oyo state but across the country as per our primary elections. They can help us ensure that there is direct primary in Ondo state,” Adelekan Julius, said Another leader, Olayioye Olayinka, said “the issue of imposition, consensus and direct primaries have been a stumbling block for the progress of the party. Although we have been nurturing it silently and which has been difficult for us to come out but we knew it is high time we came out so that we can let people know how it is really affecting us. “The situation has affected the youths badly. We are using the protest to send signals to all the party leadership not only in Oyo state but nationally so that all our leaders need to see. We as progressive youths are saying no to consensus candidates, godsons, the imposition of candidates and indirect primaries any more.” He assured that similar protest was ongoing in Ondo state to show youths are united across the region and country on the demand. Another leader, Ademola Sangokunle from Afijio local government, said the purpose of the protest was to call the attention of the member of the National Working Committee (NWC) from the state to the situation through the state party leaders, especially as it relates to the demand of the youths. Reacting, Oyo State APC Secretary, Mr Mojeed Olaoye, who led some officials of the party to address the protesters, assured that the state will communicate the demands to the appropriate quarters, commending the youths for being peaceful in their approach Vanguard By Omeiza Ajayi – Abuja A support group of the All Progressives Congress APC in Ondo State, Youth for Change Y4C on Wednesday stormed the national secretariat of the party in protest over the adoption of the indirect method of voting for the APC's July 20 governorship primary election in… July 16, 2020 In "Politics" Dayo Johnson - Akure Members of the All Progressives Congress members in Ondo State have staged a protest against the indirect mode of primary reportedly adopted by the party for the July 20 primary election.
