The State government recently introduced additional stringent measures to deter sex offenders. In addition to naming and shaming, persons convicted of sex offences will not benefit from the Governor’s powers of the prerogative of mercy and will. A statement from the Justice Ministry explained that: “The Ekiti State Ministry Of Justice today published the details of another convicted sex offender. He is Bayo Akintewe, a 66-year-old man resident in Ado-Ekiti. Akintewe was convicted by a High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti for the rape of a 16-year-old girl (identity withheld). “According to a statement from the office of the Ekiti State Attorney-General & Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda, the publication is in furtherance of the ‘name and shame sex offenders policy’ of the Ekiti State Government.  The Government of Ekiti State was the first state in Nigeria to open sex offenders register for the purpose of keeping records of convicted sex offenders in the State. “The State government recently introduced additional stringent measures to deter sex offenders.

Under the new proposals, the offence of rape will on conviction attract life imprisonment.” Vanguard It is my fervent hope that a Sex Offenders Register can be opened nationally and in all our States.
