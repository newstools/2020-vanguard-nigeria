The Workshop which commenced on Tuesday, 23rd June 2020, is expected to run in batches for three weeks, as three sets of participants are expected to participate in the Workshop. Declaring the Workshop opened at the Conference Hall, Watbridge Hotels and Suites, His Excellency, Governor Udom Emmanuel emphasized that the need for critical attention to be given to the Capacity Building of Civil Servants for effective service delivery in the State has hugely become compelling and a key factor of development in his Completion Agenda. His Excellency, Governor Emmanuel posited that ” that Japan rose from the arteries of defeat after the Civil War and in a few short years became the second largest economy in the world which is just being surpassed recently by China was due to the diligence and professionalism the Civil Service brought to bear in their job execution processes. Same applied to Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew. We can make our Civil Service the envy of other states. We should not be bound by perceived wisdom or the moulds and layers of convention. We should try new angles to serving our people and have their interest at the centre of all our engagements” “Let me start by thanking our highly admired and respected resource person in this event, the affable and hugely cerebral motivational speaker per excellence, Prof. Vincent C. Anigbogu, for agreeing to conduct this exercise. Americans have a saying that, you are what you eat and drink. Put differently, a leader is as effective as the people he surrounds himself with. If he or she is surrounded by people who lack capacity, intellectual rigour or analytical skills, such a leader would be experiencing diminished output on the part of his or her lieutenants. It is, therefore, a welcome development that this seminar is taking place at this time when the distillation of my legacies are beginning to be condensed when the completion agenda would be executed to its logical conclusion. I am glad that participants in this retreat are men and women of calibre, desirous to learn new approaches to solving problems, applying ideas and thoughts that are not defined by conventional wisdom or belief. Though people have the erroneous impression that, the Civil or Public Service is populated by those who do not professionally, emotionally or even spiritually affect the success of the system, l want to humbly disagree. I am sure and hopeful that, at the end of this exercise, participants would be reinvigorated and re-energized with new vistas of job deliverables. I am therefore pleased to declare this training open” Governor Emmanuel averred. Representing His Excellency, Secretary to State Government, Dr Emmanuel Ekuwem, stated that, the post COVID – 19 reports that were submitted to the Governor identified few infractions in the attitudinal orientation of the citizens, hence, recommended attitudinal shift of the citizenry as a most urgent need to reposition Akwa Ibom State to properly weather the post COVID – 19 economic hardships, thereby making this training to be timely and apt. In his words, “Today marks a milestone in His Excellency’s Completion and transformation agenda, given that he has consistently steered the ship of excellence service delivery in Akwa Ibom State as clearly demonstrated in the approval of this all-important Conference for Senior Cadre Civil Servants in the State. Let nobody say that Civil Service as is where is for the unenterprising, or for the mediocre, or is for the not sufficiently taught, that is absolutely false. There are very intelligent people, very smart people in the Civil Service who also work hard. There is a great difference between working hard and working smart. Working smart, success is guaranteed, but working hard success is a 50% probability. The resource person for this event does comprehensive Human Capacity training. It is a wholesome training to make all of you better people. What you would gain in this training will help in your post-retirement. It will be of great good to you. It is absolutely for your own good, to make you become creative to be able to do your job well and get tasks accomplished on time”. Speaking further, Dr Ekuwem, explained that, as evidenced in the ongoing Workshop, the government has constantly proven that part of its fundamental objectives is the development of a knowledge-driven workforce that would largely draw its strength from new methodologies and innovativeness towards achieving more. Adding that, it is his strong conviction that, the Capacity Building would be one that will affect not only the Akwa Ibom State Civil Servants, but the entire state and generations to come, as Akwa Ibom people begin to change their mindset. “Never you be comfortable with any status quo, that is mediocrity. Never settle for how long you have been doing it. It is not about how long they have been doing it, it is about how well you have been doing it. You have to be a creative worker. That is the essence of what His Excellency, the Governor is doing. Learn how to challenge the status quo, think outside the box, do not settle for less. Be the best, that is what the governor desires from you, that this state must have the best workforce in this nation. Dr Ekuwem reiterated.
