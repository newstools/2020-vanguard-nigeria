BASED on due considerations for the health, safety and general well-being of thousands of young students and the other categories of stakeholders involved in the national qualifying examinations, Masterclasses and national science competitions across Nigeria and Kenya annually, Interswitch Group has moved the activities planned for the 2020 / 2021 edition of InterswitchSPAK National Science competition. According to a statement from the company, the global concern regarding the Coronavirus outbreak and its outlook which remains unclear, including travel and social gathering concerns among other considerations, make it extremely challenging to proceed with the implementation of the 2020 edition as earlier planned. Having explored the options open to them including logistics of staging a fully virtual implementation of the competition, the organisers have come to the resolution that the most optimal course of action would be to defer the season. Speaking about the deferment, Cherry Eromosele, the Group Chief Marketing and Communication Officer at Interswitch stated that the organisation had commenced constructive engagement with various stakeholders and partners who work with them annually on this initiative and would continue to work with them as they plan towards the subsequent season of the project. She said: “We have no doubt that the appropriate course to take as a socially responsible organization, is to defer this year’s edition of InterswitchSPAK until the dangers to public health posed by the pandemic are sufficiently mitigated. To this effect, we have formally ceased ongoing registration of candidates by schools across Nigeria and Kenya for the current year, following engagement with relevant concerned educational authorities and stakeholders in both countries”, Vanguard  Sixteen-Year-Old Akachukwu Anumudu of Apostolic Faith Secondary School, Anthony, Lagos, on Saturday, February 9, 2019, emerged winner of the first edition of the InterswitchSPAK National Science Competition held in Lagos - Nigeria.
