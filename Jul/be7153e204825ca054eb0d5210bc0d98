Three foreign nationals and six Nigerians, who are staff members of Pilgrim Africa Limited, have been ordered to be remanded by a Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt for allegedly aiding and abetting kidnapping, sea piracy and concealing terrorism. The Nigerian Navy Ship Pathfinder had arrested the nine suspects after they had allegedly paid the sum of $200,000, to pirates who had kidnapped some staff members of the said company. The suspects, who are standing trial on three counts preferred against them by the Federal Government bothering on conspiracy and terrorism, were reported to have transported the kidnap victims to Calabar in Cross River State after they were freed by their abductors. The charges in FHC/PH/62C/2020 read in part: “That you, Binaebi Johnson, Daniel Lemmer, Ghane Gordon, and Pilgrim Africa Limited, all male, adult and of Pilgrim Africa Limited, Port Harcourt, Rivers State sometime within May 2020 at Port Harcourt, Rivers State did conspire amongst yourselves to facilitate the payment of ransom of $200,000 .00 for the release of the hostages namely: Mr Abaamrane Hamid, Mr. Chalabi Abdelaziz, Mr. Santos Ndong to Pirates who attacked MV ELOBEY VI, an Equatorial Guinea flagged Vessel off Equatorial Guinea Coast and held the crew members hostage and you thereby committed an offence contrary to section 17 (1) of Terrorism Prevention (Amendment) Act 2013.” However, the nine suspects pleaded not guilty to all the charges levelled against them by the government.
