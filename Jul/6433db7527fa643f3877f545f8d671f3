Reports in Italy claim sources close to the Nigerian star, 21, have confirmed the forward will reject Gennaro Gattuso’s side. Instead, Osimhen will hold out for a move to the Premier League, with Arsenal and United leading the race, says Football Italia. The Lille forward has been pursued by Napoli for months now. Osimhen met boss Gattuso and was even invited to club president Aurelio De Laurentiis’ home on the island of Capri. On leaving, the striker asked for a few days to think about his next move. But after weeks of being charmed by Napoli, Osimhen is on the verge of knocking them back in order to try to force a move to the Premier League. Napoli had agreed to a £46million fee to sign Osimhen, say reports in Italy. The Serie A giants, who’ve endured a horror season by their high standards, were also said to have offered him a monster salary. Osimhen has quickly emerged as one of Europe’s top prospects. The eight-cap Nigeria international has scored 18 goals in just 38 games for Lille this season while laying on six assists. And the Ligue 1 side are unwilling to let him go cheaply. While Napoli are thought to have negotiated Lille down to just £46m, Arsenal were recently told to fork out “close to what they paid for Nicolas Pepe” last summer: £72m. Vanguard Liverpool have joined Tottenham in submitting a €70million bids for Lille striker Victor Osimhen, according to reports. The 21-year-old, brought in last summer to replace the Arsenal-bound Nicolas Pepe, has filled those shoes impressively with 18 goals in 38 games.
