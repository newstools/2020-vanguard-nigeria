The convict, who was docked before Justice Peter Life, was said to have fraudulently obtained the money from his American victim. The Prosecutor from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, AbduRasheed Sulaeman, told the court that the convict impersonated one Troy Stone to dupe his victim. Sulaeman tendered as exhibit before the court, the money recovered from the convict, one iPhone 7, his confessional statement, and pictures of nude photographs printed on his email. The convict pleaded guilty to the crime and opted for plea bargaining. His counsel, Dotun Akinsanmi, urged the court to temper justice with mercy in sentencing him, noting that he has spent about 73 days in the custody of EFCC. Justice Life, however, found him guilty (of the internet fraud) as charged and ordered that he should be remanded in a correctional facility and adjourned to July 21, 2020, to sentence the convict.
