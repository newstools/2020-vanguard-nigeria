He also called for the “proscription of the Evwreni community vigilante team that is being used by a Traditional ruler to perpetrate crime so that a new one can be set up”. Reacting to the murder of Sylvester Adjogbe in the community, Ughere urged security agents to investigate the recent killings in the community, particularly that of Mr Sylvester Adjogbe, and bring the perpetrators to book. Enjoining all illustrious sons and daughters of the kingdom to come together and step into the matter and proffer solutions to the contentious issues, he said the community has not known peace since a traditional ruler was allegedly wrongly installed in the kingdom. He said he had expected the indigenes of the kingdom to learn from the crisis which broke out in the community in 2000 where so many people were killed and many fled the kingdom. He said: “Unfortunately, it was what happened at that time that is rearing it’s ugly head in the community again. “The ancestors of the kingdom should be appeased for all the wrongs that were done in the past so that we can correct them. The traditional stool that was wrongly put in place should be looked into and reversed.” Vanguard News The elder brother of Sylvester Adjogbe, who was killed in cold blood in the troubled Evwerni community in Delta state,  Lucky Adjogbe has petitioned the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu and Commissioner of Police CP, Delta State Police Command, Mr Hafiz Mohammed Inuwa to investigate the circumstances that… July 4, 2020 In "News" FORMER Executive Director, Projects on the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, Engr Samuel Adjogbe, has reiterated the sincerity and commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari to giving key attention to the oil-rich region.
