He commended the governor for his quick response to the natural disaster, noting that the governor had put a call to him, as soon as the incident occurred, which enabled him to schedule the meeting. “Our intention is to do a design with a new concrete bridge across the waterways and that will take us about eight weeks going by the design team of the ministry,” he said. In his response,  Gov. Lalong, thanked the minister for scheduling the meeting within a short notice and assembling the relevant departments with the view to finding short and long term solutions to the problem. Lalong said that he was compelled to call the attention of the minister immediately, to the incident, due to the extent of damage to the bridge. “Due to the level of damage on the bridge and the importance of the bridge to the State, I quickly put a call to the Minister to which he responded by calling for this meeting. ” I thank him for the timeline given in addressing the issue,” the governor said.
