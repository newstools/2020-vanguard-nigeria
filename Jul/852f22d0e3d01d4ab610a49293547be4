She also added that they have enough potential Housemate and if some test positive to the virus, they will be replaced. She also announced that the online auditions which they did back in May was a huge success with over 32 thousand entries being recorded from BBNaija hopefuls across Nigeria.

BBNaija season 5 will be broadcast live and 24/7 on DStv channel 198 and GOtv Max and Jolli packages on channel 29, with the live eviction shows and weekly highlights aired on Africa Magic Showcase, Africa Magic Urban and Africa Magic Family.
