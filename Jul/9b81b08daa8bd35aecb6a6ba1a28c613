The customs spokesman said the boys were rushed to Customs clinic for proper medical intervention and fortunately the result came out with no major damages. “This gave room for prompt treatment of the patients at Customs facility and were consequently discharged strictly based on medical advice. “On this note, the command wish to register its unreserved displeasure with this unfortunate incident. “As a responsible and responsive service, we are working round the clock to partner with the family by providing all the necessary support to cushion the effect of this tragedy,” he said. Abdullahi, however, said the renewed hostility by smugglers and their accomplices would never be a distraction in discharging its statutory responsibilities. He promised that smugglers would always meet there waterloo with no breathing space in Seme command.
