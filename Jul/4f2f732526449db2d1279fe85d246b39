Zhao said the requirement was a “completely necessary counter-action against the U.S.’ unreasonable suppression of Chinese media agencies” in the U.S. Washington June ordered that four Chinese state media outlets, China Central Television, the China News Service, the People’s Daily and The Global Times, register as “foreign missions,” facing requirements similar to embassies and consulates in the U.S. The two countries have sparred for months over media operations against the background of heightened tensions in areas such as trade, the coronavirus outbreak and Hong Kong’s autonomy. In March, the U.S. imposed a personnel cap on four Chinese media outlets, forcing them to reduce the number of employees on U.S. territory from 160 to 100. Beijing retaliated by expelling all U.S. newsmen working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.
