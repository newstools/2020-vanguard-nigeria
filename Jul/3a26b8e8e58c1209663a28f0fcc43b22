She contributed immensely to the decimation of enemies of our nation. Her death has really affected us in one way or the other”, the CAS said. To the Family of the late Flying Officer, he said, “There can be no better consolation for Tolulope Arotile than the knowledge that the nation griefs with you for the loss of such a fantastic and committed patriot. Thank you, Tolu for adding so much value to the Nigerian Airforce and the nation at large”.
