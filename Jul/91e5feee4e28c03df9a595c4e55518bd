The policemen who stormed the monarch’s palace in Commando style, after he allegedly refused to honour invitation extended to him by the command, threw the community into confusion.

Saying that investigation was still in progress, Inuwa debunked claims that the Monarch was abducted. He said: “we went there to arrest him for refusing to honour our invitation over a suspected murder case. “He has since be left to go home, and he apologized for not initially honouring the invitation.” Vanguard The question is now ringing louder and louder with the passing of each week.
