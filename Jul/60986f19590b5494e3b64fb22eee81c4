Look at what happened in Udege – Loko Road where these strangers, our children together with some indegenious tribe of the area, whisk away 30 people to an unknown destination?”. “Let’s us restrategize, if your son, brother or anyone you know is among these bad eggs, bring them out or the law will take its course on you the leaders”. Hussaini illiteracy and hard drugs as the major factors pushing people into crime, hence the need for security agents to rise up to their responsibility of reducing crime. Also speaking, Lawal Dono, Chairman of Ardos in Nasarawa State, said as leaders, they would not harbour criminal elements, assuring that they would direct their people to provide  security agencies with relevant information about criminal elements since they are the ones  in the bush.
