Chairman of the Committee and state Commissioner for Health, Dr Innocent Vakkai while addressing the press in Jalingo on Wednesday explained that the 24 new cases were contacts of those who tested positive earlier. Vakkai, however, said the new cases were accumulated results and not recorded in a single day. He also raised concerns over public disregard to the precautionary measures outlined to avoid the spread of the virus. According to him, “some of the reasons for the rise in the number of COVID-19 positive cases is the attitude of the citizens and their non-compliance to the COVID-19 guidelines.” He, however, called on residents of the state to quit playing with these measures, adding that the pandemic is not yet over. He further mentioned that the state has so far tested over 500 samples since the start of the pandemic, of which only 54 positive cases were recorded.
