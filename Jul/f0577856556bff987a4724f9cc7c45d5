The Systems Platform solution is expected to provide a robust, up-to-date database of Federal and Sub-National resource and availability requirements for the COVID-19 response, based on the World Health Organisation, WHO recommended resource specifications on packages for COVID-19. Speaking on the development, Chief Executive Officer of the NESG, Laoye Jaiyeola said once deployed, the Systems Platform will provide a National and Sub-National Inventory Management System that gives national visibility of what is procured, in-stock and out-of-stock across the Federal and State Testing, Treatment and Isolation Centres. Jaiyeola said: “The real-time data provided will enable government, the private sector, international organisations, and other donors to mobilize more effectively in providing the critical human and material resources needed to support the country’s response to the pandemic”. On his part, the Director of AIG, Ofovwe Aig-Imoukhuede described the initiative as key for the future of Nigeria’s COVID-19 response. According to him, beyond improving the transparency, accountability, and governance of national resources co-sourced from the public, private and development sectors towards the COVID-19 response, the Predictive Analytic Model embedded in the Platform would enable the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, predict and project the rate of infections, deaths and consequent resource requirements. “The Systems Platform is expected to improve the National and State Health Information Management System by adding the Platform’s capabilities seamlessly to the country’s existing data ecosystem. “The overarching objective is to help in galvanizing efforts at efficiently plugging nationwide resource gaps across the three priority areas of Testing, Treatment, and Isolation and Contact Tracing and Tracking in the context of COVID-19.” On May 19, 2020, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, which is constituted by heads of the Federal Ministry of Health, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, and other Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government endorsed the partnership between Africa Initiative for Governance and the Nigerian Economic Summit Group for the development of the Systems Platform.
