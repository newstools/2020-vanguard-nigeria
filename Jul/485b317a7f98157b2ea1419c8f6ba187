The 22-year-old put in some outstanding displays to guide Leipzig to the Champions League quarter-finals, impressing in both games against Tottenham in the round of 16. Spurs themselves have been linked with Mukiele as Jose Mourinho looks for an upgrade on current right-back Serge Aurier. However, the latest report out of France reckons that Klopp wants to bring the versatile defender to Liverpool in the upcoming transfer window. Le10Sport (via Sport Witness) claims that the Reds boss ‘wants’ Mukiele, who can play at right-back or in central defence, and Liverpool have ‘already made arrangements’ to start discussions with Mukiele and his representatives. The report adds that Klopp ‘has already spoken’ with the Leipzig defender and that Paris Saint-Germain will provide Liverpool with ‘solid competition’. Speaking on Wednesday about the possibility of Liverpool strengthening in the summer, Klopp said: “To strengthen the squad you need money and these are uncertain times. Obviously, uncertain times means for some clubs we cannot do what we would do in non-uncertain times. “Ask me can we develop the squad and it is probably possible, but only with real money. “We have talents ourselves, big talents, and players who can make big steps in our squad. But buying now? “Just go out there and name whoever you want, whatever the player is, go for it? That is really difficult. “We did not invest a lot in the squad last year and that was before COVID-19. “If we have money, we will spend. If we do not know if we will have money, we probably will not spend that much. That is how it is.” Football 365 Vanguard Bundesliga expert Raphael Honigstein claims that Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has held a “virtual meeting” with RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner in “recent weeks”.
