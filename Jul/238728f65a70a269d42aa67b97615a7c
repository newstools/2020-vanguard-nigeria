According to an eye witness who gave his name simply as Liberty, the victims, a female and 2 males including the driver were occupants of a Volkswagen Golf.  The vehicle, he said was heading towards Banex junction from Gwarimpa axis when suddenly it lost control, speedily jumped over the culvert and ran into an oncoming truck from the opposite direction. The accident happened adjacent The Capital Hub plaza around 8 pm on Sunday. Liberty told Vanguard that the Golf driver died instantly while the other two persons had several deep cuts into their stomachs in what had turned into a mangled vehicle.
