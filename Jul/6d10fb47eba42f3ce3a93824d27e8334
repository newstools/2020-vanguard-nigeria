The Acting Controller of the state command of the NIS, DCI Abdullahi Abba Dahatu, confirmed that 12 out of the 42 repatriated Nigerians had been arraigned before a Federal High Court sitting in Katsina while investigations of the others were still in progress. According to Dalhatu, they were brought before the court of law by the immigration service for evading immigration clearance while crossing Nigerian borders to another country through illegal routes. “The rest will soon be arraigned upon completion of charges against them.
