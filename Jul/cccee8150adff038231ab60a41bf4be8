The two convicts were among 25 arrested persons over the death, which after investigations, eight suspects were charged to court while six others were discharged and acquitted. Ozongwu was brutally murdered on December 23, 2015, in a farm close to his country home in Ngwo, by suspected members of his community over a portion of land belonging to the state government but which was rented to the late Lawyer. Reacting to the judgment on behalf of the family, Chief Eric Ozongwu, said that even though the family was happy that justice was served, they were not satisfied that some suspects were set free. Ozongwu revealed that they were ready to appeal the judgment which freed six of the suspects.
