The England midfielder climbed into the stands after Spurs’ penalty shoot-out loss having been angered by the actions of a supporter at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Stewards intervened to separate Dier from the individual, with manager Jose Mourinho saying afterwards that his player had reacted to insults towards his younger brother. Dier was charged with misconduct by the Football Association (FA) in April. He denied his actions had been threatening, but an independent regulatory commission found otherwise, with the FA confirming his sanction on Wednesday. “Eric Dier has been suspended for four matches with immediate effect, fined £40,000 and warned as to his future conduct following a breach of FA Rule E3,” read an FA statement. “The Tottenham Hotspur FC player admitted that his actions at the conclusion of a fixture against Norwich City FC in the FA Cup on March 4, 2020, were improper but denied that they were also threatening. “An independent regulatory commission subsequently found Eric Dier’s actions to be threatening.” The suspension comes into immediate effect, meaning Dier will miss all but one of Spurs’ remaining five Premier League games, which includes the derby against Arsenal on Sunday.
