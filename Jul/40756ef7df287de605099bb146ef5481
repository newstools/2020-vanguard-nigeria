Aida Benjamin ( real name Adaku Uwaoma Oseiza), the current Marketing Director for Enyimba Automated Shoe Company, Abia State is a woman of many parts.

And also to continue to encourage other Nigerians to support the less privileged, whatever we raise from our songs will continue to go to charity. I believe that God has given us talents and we must use them in one way or the other. Politics or business or career or family should not stop us. There’s not a better time than now that the world needs healing right from the soul to have such an amazing single.” Aida is all fired up to release her first professional single titled “Obi Uto ( Danciya )” coming out on August 2, 2020. The single, which was produced by Mekoyo at U&I Recording Studios will be dropping completely with the video shot by Toca Mcbaror. “This song brings hope and comfort while challenging us all to make the world a better place, especially by remembering the poor among us.
