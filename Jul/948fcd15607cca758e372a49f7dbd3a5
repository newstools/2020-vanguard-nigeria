While the contract isn’t completely guaranteed many NFL contracts aren’t the total value of it surpasses the 12-year, $426 million deal Mike Trout signed with the Los Angeles Angels in 2019 as the most expensive contract in sports. Mahomes’ contract includes an injury guarantee reportedly worth $140 million. The dynamic quarterback was entering the fourth year of his rookie deal that paid him $16 million guaranteed. He could have become a free agent in 2022. The 24-year-old Mahomes, the son of former Mets pitcher Pat Mahomes, tossed 50 touchdowns in his first full season in the league and last year guided the Chiefs to a come-from-behind Super Bowl victory over the 49ers, completing 26-of-42 passes for 286 yards and two scores and running for another. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson previously owned the NFL’s richest contract with a four-year deal, $140 million deal ($107 million guaranteed). Mahomes’ new deal will also mark the longest NFL contract extension in league history, eclipsing the eight-year, $98.6 million pact Dallas Cowboys offensive tackle Tyron Smith signed in 2014.
