We were inundated with the report that at some point, passers-by were being robbed of their cell-phones and money by miscreants using dangerous weapons to scare innocent people. “It is in view of this that we call on the public to comply with these guidelines and the directives are given. We will not hesitate to take prompt legal action against anyone who flouted the rules with impunity. We cannot just fold our arms and allow some irresponsible elements to perpetrate their nefarious activities,” Sanusi however said.
