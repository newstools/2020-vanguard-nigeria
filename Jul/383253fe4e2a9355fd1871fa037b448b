Being sexy is dressing really well and the charisma that comes with the poise. However, I believe everyone should do what makes them comfortable. I love to be simple, classy and chic, not revealing too much of the skin and shocking people. The confidence you exude when properly dressed and the attitude along with it is all it takes for me,” she said in a chat with Vanguard’s Potpourri.
