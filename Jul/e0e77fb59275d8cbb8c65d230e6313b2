The widow was kidnapped along with her driver while escorting the remains of her late husband, Zakawanu Garuba, who died in the early hours of Friday, to Auchi, Etsako West Local Government Area for burial. However, the faith of her driver is unknown, but her late husband has been buried in Auchi in accordance with Islamic rites. Earlier, she, her three children and the aged mother of the late Speaker were driving behind the ambulance carrying her husband, when they were accosted by the suspected kidnappers around Kabba Junction, near Okenne. The kidnappers were said to have abandoned Zakawanu’s mother and his three children in the vehicle, while they went away with Hassana and the driver. A family member confirmed the development but said they were yet to be contacted, while Garuba body was yet to arrive Auchi. He, however, said arrangement was being made to bring the children and their grandmother home. It would be recalled that on September 3, 2016, Hassana was kidnapped at Obadan village near Ogbemudia Farms, about 15 minutes drive from Benin along Benin-Okenne-Lokojo Road. She was going to her station in Ehor, where she is a magistrate, when the suspected kidnappers attacked commuters and went away with her and some other persons. She was released days after ransom was paid by her now late husband. Contacted on this development, the Commissioner of Police in Edo state, Johnson Kokumo, had said: “I have been informed of the unfortunate incident and we are working to ensure that the remaining persons get to Auchi safely. “Kogi State Police is working on the situation to ensure the woman is rescued.” Vanguard "There is no good Brexit!" insists Greg McDonald, chief executive of Goodfish Group, a UK-based company making plastic components for the country's key car sector.
