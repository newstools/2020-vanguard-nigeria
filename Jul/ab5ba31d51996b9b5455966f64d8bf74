The army said in a statement that its forces succeeded in foiling “an attack by takfiri terrorist elements on one of the security complexes” in the town of Bir al-Abd. Egyptian security officials use the term “takfiri” to designate extremist Islamist militants. “In cooperation with the air force, security forces managed to chase the takfiri elements across a farm and in abandoned houses killing 18, including one wearing an explosive belt,” the statement said. Two military personnel were killed and four others wounded in Tuesday’s operations in Bir al-Abd. Troops also destroyed four cars including three that were packed with explosives.

The late Tuesday statement came after videos surfaced on social media purportedly showing plumes of smoke, gunfire and residents screaming for their lives. AFP could not verify the authenticity of the short clips posted online.
