Speaking at the flag-off in Lagos, the Executive Director, ISN Products Nigeria Limited, Mr. Felix Ofungwu, also explained that the award was to promote quality laboratory practice, encourage professionalism among practitioners and reduce rising cases of misdiagnosis. Describing Medical Laboratory Scientists as the Unsung Heroes of the medical practice, he said the award was instituted as part of the company’s contribution towards encouraging and promoting excellence amongst Medical Laboratory Scientists. “Medical Laboratory Scientists are the bedrock of the medical practice as all others including the Doctors, Nurses and Pharmacists rely on their diagnosis to provide quality healthcare and treatment,” he said. Stating that the entry for the award opened Wednesday, June 24, 2020, and would close on August 22, 2020, he said: “Interested medical laboratory scientists are to download the form from ISN’s website. He enjoined applicants to complete the form and submit it for verification and evaluation by the jury. On eligibility, he stated that an applicant must have requisite academic qualification must be registered with the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN), and must be working in a registered Lab or hospital. The Winner of the Award would receive a cash prize of N1 million, capacity development training, and donation of medical lab equipment/reagents valued at N1 million to the laboratory or hospital where he or she works. “The first runner-up will receive a cash prize of N750, 000 and capacity development training and the second runner-up will receive a cash prize of N500, 000 and capacity development training while seven other finalists will receive consolatory prizes of N200, 000 each,” he added. Speaking, the Immediate Past President, Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria, AMLSN, Dr. Toyosi Raheem, who expressed gratitude on behalf of the association disclosed that most of 201 diagnostic reagents which found their way into the country in the last four months of the pandemic are performing below standard. According to him, causes of misdiagnosis stem from wrong reagents, equipment, poor environment, unqualified professionals among others. Raheem stated that the award is not only a competition amongst medical laboratory scientists but also an inter-institutional competition because the prizes and rewards will be extended to the institutions wherein the winners work and will also bring recognition to medical laboratories and institutions.
