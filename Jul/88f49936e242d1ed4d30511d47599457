Leighton Baines has announced his retirement from football following the end of Everton’s Premier League campaign. Former England international Baines – who had been offered a one-year contract extension by Everton – made his 420th and final appearance for the Toffees on Sunday, as Carlo Ancelotti’s side went down 3-1 to Bournemouth. The 35-year-old, who has made nine appearances in all competitions this season, came on as a second-half substitute at Goodison Park. Baines joined Everton from Wigan Athletic in 2007, going on to become one of the Premier League’s most consistent full-backs. He scored 39 goals for Everton and was the club’s first-choice left-back until Lucas Digne’s arrival from Barcelona in 2018. Baines’ last goal for Everton came in an EFL Cup tie against Leicester City in December, with the defender scoring a stunning long-range strike late on, only for the Foxes to win on penalties.
