National Chairman of the party, Mr. Uche Secondus, who stated this at a press conference on Friday in Abuja urged journalists and media executives to investigate all cases of corruption and publish it for the public. He expressed concern that the situation of corruption in the country was becoming worsening as critical agencies of government, including the anti-graft agencies, were alleged to be involved in the scandal. Secondus said some of the exposed alleged cases of corruption were those in the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), the Maritime Sector, the Customs, the Federal inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF, North East Development Commission and sale of crude oil to China, among others. The chairman urged the media to ensure that all ongoing exposed alleged cases of corruption were not swept under the carpet. He also urged the National Assembly to urgently amend the constitution and relevant laws to ensure that those who stole the country’s money would not escape with it. The chairman called on the Federal Government to ensure that it applied the law for the prosecution of those accused of corruption irrespective of their party affiliations. Secondus also expressed concerns about the issue of insecurity in the country. He expressed the party’s support for the call by the Senate that the security chiefs should retire to give room for fresh hands and ideas.
