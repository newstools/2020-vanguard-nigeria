In a statement, ABCON urged members of the public to patronise CBN licensed BDCs to purchase dollars at the official price, so as to avoid falling victim of currency hoarders and speculators, who are creating impression of dollar scarcity in the economy.  The association said there is no pressure in the foreign exchange market to warrant increase in the exchange rate above the official rate. ABCON stated: “In recent times, governments across the world, in a bid to stop the spread of the deadly Covid-19 virus, have imposed travel restrictions which has led to sharp decline in the volume of global passenger travel. “Trade is also at its lowest level globally due to widespread shutting down of businesses in most countries especially China which accounts for about 25 percent of Nigeria’s import. “One of the consequences of these developments  is general decline in demand for trade and travel related services including foreign exchange. In recent times ABCON has observed a steady decline in  demand for dollars across the various categories of forex end users. “Based on this observation and information from  BDC members of ABCON, we can categorically state that demand for dollars is at one of its lowest point in the market. Furthermore, CBN has sustained its weekly dollar sale to BDCs at the same level,  hence keeping dollar supply constant and eliminating any apprehension of scarcity or rationing of forex. “In view of the above, we believe there is no need for anybody to buy dollars from anyone at exchange rate above the official rate. CBN sells dollars to BDCs at N357 per dollar while BDCs are mandated to sell to the public at N360 per dollar for eligible transactions namely, BTA; PTA; Medicals; Mortgage; and School fees
“In view of the above, ABCON hereby appeals to members of the public that there is enough dollar supply to meet demand for any of the above eligible transactions at the CBN approved rate of N360 per dollar.  Members of the public should be free to approach any of the  CBN licensed BDCs who are also ABCON members, to buy dollars at the official exchange rate  to meet any of the eligible transactions stated above.
“ABCON also enjoins all BDCs to ensure compliance to CBN regulations in all transactions with members of the public. Any BDC found selling dollars above the official exchange rate of N360 or violating any regulatory requirements or will be severely sanctioned, and also risk the revocation of its operating license.
