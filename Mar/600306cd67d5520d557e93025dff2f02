Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Ekong Sampson, who gave the warning during an inspection exercise by a joint special team of some sites used for the informal operations in Ikot Ekong, Mkpat Enin council and other councils, said ‘’the government will take appropriate steps in checking the activities of illegal miners in the state as they pose serious threat to the environment.’’ He expressed worries that if the activities of the illegal miners are not checked, families and indeed the communities might vanish in the future.
