The Senior Akeredolu had during his 3rd-anniversary dinner in Akure said his son, Babajide worked hard during his campaign and there is nothing anyone can do if he decides to appoint him as his chief of staff. “When somebody says Baba (Babajide) is this, I just laugh at them. If I wanted to make Baba my chief of staff, he can be; did you do more than him in the campaign? Ask yourself, how many of you did more than Baba in the campaign? How many?” he asked. “The young boy was going everywhere and all of us saw him but we decided not to because he wouldn’t want it. My son is satisfied, that’s why. If he is not, I will put him somewhere, there is nothing anybody can do. I will put him there, there is nothing you can do. Is he not my son? Is he not from Ondo state? Has he not worked?” Reacting to the story published by an online medium, Babajide tweeted that he was glad his father could consider him that position. He, however, said he would gladly decline because his father is a workaholic who might overwork him leading to needless clashes. Babajide whose Twitter profile reads ‘A slave to Ondo state’  said he would prefer to stick to his consultancy job.  Lol, glad he is proud of me (that was the real message that evening) but me I don’t want. With the workaholic that he is, working everyday from 7am to midnight with my oga na fight. Me and him will just be clashing anyhow. Yeah, I’ll stay with my consulting work. https://t.co/VD8cLZ8GGv — Irunmole of Faaji (@1babse) March 1, 2020  Vanguard WITH 244,842 votes, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, of the All Progressives Congress, APC, was, yesterday, declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, as the winner of Saturday’s governorship election.
