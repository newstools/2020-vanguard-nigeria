This committee is headed by Professor Maurice Iwu, who as we may know is almost at the verge of inventing a cure for the disease. “In addition, the committee has experienced public health care providers as members, including members of the Nigerian Medical Association. I have no doubt that we have all it takes to guarantee that we are safe from the deadly fangs of the virus. “To ensure this, the government will spare no resources to facilitate the committee’s assignment which is to do all that is necessary to ensure that the Coronavirus does not have a foothold in Imo state. “Consequently adequate funds have been made available for it to carry out its assignment without let or hindrance. As I address you, the committee has already swung into action and I can assure you that very soon it will come up with a comprehensive anti Coronavirus spread template that will ensure that Imo state is clinically safe from the deadly virus. He added: “A state of the art modern ambulance has been provided for the committee to facilitate its operations. This ambulance is equipped with necessary medical gadgets for quick analysis and test for the virus and will be on 24-hour standby to respond to any emergency anywhere in the state “In addition, we are liaising with the national centre for disease control to ensure that we buy into the federal government’s Coronavirus prevention roadmap. Similarly, we are tracking global updates on the disease so as to remain ever vigilant on global efforts at control and eradication.” It was the government’s plan that “We have also concluded arrangements to establish a specialist hospital specifically charged with control and prevention of contagious diseases.
