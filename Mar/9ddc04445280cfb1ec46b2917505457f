The ministry’s spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran’s most important Shiite shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region. Calls by Iran’s civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to the public have not been uniformly followed. The shrine in Mashhad is among those that have remained open. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and a whopping 385 new cases of infections. The new numbers, however, bring down the percentage of deaths to infections from 20% to around 5.5%. Still, that is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections may also be much higher. Jahanpour said in his daily briefing that the number of cases is “still inclining” across Iran. Also on Sunday, Iran’s state broadcaster said all flights to the city of Rasht, the capital of northern Gilan province, had been suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak. It gave no reasons why. The area of Gilan has some of Iran’s highest number of infections after the capital, Tehran, and the holy city of Qom, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in the country. The illness, known as COVID-19 and that originated in central China, has infected at least seven government officials in Iran, including one of its vice presidents and a senior health ministry official. Iran has said it is preparing for the possibility of “tens of thousands” of people getting tested for the virus behind the outbreak. Of the more than 1,100 cases in the Middle East, the majority trace back to the Islamic Republic. The virus has infected more than 86,000 people worldwide and caused more than 2,900 deaths since emerging in China. Iran has the world’s highest death toll outside of China.
