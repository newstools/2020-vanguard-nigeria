They said that speed and seriousness or otherwise demonstrated by the government in ensuring that all the victims are quarantined would, in large part, determine the state of the market in the medium term. They, however, said that the downturn still presents opportunity for value investors to buy.

According to Johnson Chukwu, Managing Director/CEO, Cowry Asset Management, the shock would moderate next week depending on the level of intervention by the Federal Government. “A lot will depend on how the government responds to the problem; particularly, people are looking to see whether they can trace all the contacts of the Convid-19 patient and possibly quarantine them just like they did during the Ebola era “If the government does not do that, people will keep worrying, especially in the face of the dense population of Lagos State and the market will panic more though it might not be as drastic as the level of sell-off on Friday. Government must be more serious by tracing his contacts,” he said. Corroborating, Mallam Garba Kurfi, Managing Director/CEO, APT Securities and Funds, said the losses recorded on Friday was not surprising as similar losses were recorded in China on the onset of the virus. He said: “The sell-off may progress to early this week, if after one week, there is positive announcement on the level of intervention by the government, everything will normalise.” Meanwhile, sectorial analysis of the week’s trading shows that the banking sector was the worst hit at 11.8 percent decline, followed by the insurance sector with 8.2 percent decline and the consumer goods sector (-3.8%).
