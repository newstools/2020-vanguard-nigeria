In a memo to staff Wednesday, Shell said he was diagnosed with the virus after feeling sick. “I recently have been feeling under the weather and just learned that I have tested positive for Covid-19,” Shell wrote. “Although the virus has been tough to cope with, I have managed to work remotely in LA and am improving every day.” Last week, one employee, NBC News technician Larry Edgeworth, passed away from coronavirus. Earlier this week, a senior segment producer at MSNBC penned an anonymous open letter calling for the shutdown of NBCUniversal’s headquarters, 30 Rock, in light of Edgeworth’s death and the nature of the quick-spreading virus. Since last week, employees at NBCUniversal have been directed to work from home when possible. But in many cases, workers at the company’s channels NBC News, MSNBC, CNBC, Telemundo, and local stations must still go into the office. Shell thanked those employees for their “courage.” “The virus will pass, our world will return to normal, and when it does, we will be poised to have one of the busiest and most exciting years in our company’s history,” he concluded.
