More laboratories will join the network for molecular diagnosis for COVID-19 in Kaduna, Kano, Maiduguri, Port Harcourt and Sokoto. “I want to emphasize that testing is at no cost to anyone in the public and only results from any of the accredited molecular laboratories are recognised. “There are some (patients) that are due to be discharged.
