It was gathered that Kenneth Ugwu, a spare parts dealer in Lagos, reportedly returned to the village to visit his parents without the parents knowing his intention. A community source, who gave her name simply as Miss Adaeze, said that Kenneth returned from Lagos pretending to have returned to help the mother on her farmland to harvest palm fruit. “When they got to the farm, rather than cut the palm fruit for the mother, Kenneth cut-off the mother’s head and put it in a black polythene bag. “When he got home, the father inquired about the whereabouts of his wife, but he reportedly lied to him that she was on her way home. He quickly rushed to the bathroom to take a bath and leave for Lagos”, the source said. But his father, Cyril Ugwu, who was suspicious of his son’s sudden decision to return to Lagos, went to check the content of the polythene bag only to find the severed head of his wife. Irked by the heinous act, he quickly loaded his double-barrel gun and waited for the son to come out and shot him as he stepped out to leave for Lagos. The incident threw the entire community into wailing and tears as the men mobilized and went in search of the remaining parts of the remains of the slain woman. Her corpse was later found dumped on a footpath with several machete cuts all over her body. When contacted, the Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer, Ndukwe Ekea, said he has not got the report and requested to get in touch with his men in the area. Vanguard News Nigeria.
