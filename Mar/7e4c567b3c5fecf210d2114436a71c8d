He spoke, on Thursday, at the first quarterly meeting of the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council, NIREC, meeting in Abuja. However, the royal father acknowledged the insecurity in the land and expressed worry over the sincerity and commitment by members of the Council to religious peace and tolerance.

If we mistakenly do, then we are finished. There is nothing wrong with any religious organisation marching on the street to call for God’s interventions in a particular issue. “But we shouldn’t make a show of such things because we want to be visible and, therefore, bring more problems to the nation. “We have been reading and hearing reports about the persecution of Christians in Nigeria and I keep asking myself how? Christians are being killed, Muslims are also being killed and they are all lives created by God. “For me, there is no persecution of anybody in this country. If you claim there is a persecution of Christians in Nigeria, there would also be claims of persecution of Muslims, but that would not solve the problem. “People claim they are denied places to build mosques, churches in some parts of the country. But the right thing to do in such cases is to approach relevant authorities and not to make claims of persecution. “I can quote from now till the next 100 years of things that have been done or not done to Muslims, but we usually approach relevant authorities in ways that we believe would bring solutions to the problems.” ALSO READ: We’re not ordained to abuse those in power — Catholic Bishops Similarly, the Secretary to Government of the Federation, SGF, Boss Mustapha, said the claim of persecution of Christians in Nigeria was a hoax by some religious leaders to curry public sympathy. He appealed to religious leaders to be circumspect and properly guarded in their utterances to avoid inciting the people against themselves. His words: “Nigeria has recently experienced several challenges, including a spike in banditry, insurgency, kidnappings, killings and drug abuse. “It’s time for a review of approach and strategy for improved results.” Vanguard ...Says evidence abound Christians are not treated fairly in Nigeria By Luminous Jannamike - Abuja Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has dismissed claims by the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa'ad Abubakar III, that Christians were not under any form persecuted in the country, saying the monarch was insincere in his remarks.… December 26, 2019 In "News" The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) says if Sultan of Sokoto, His eminence, Sa’ad Abubakar III truly said that Christians are not being persecuted in Nigeria simply “because not all Fulanis are Muslims”, he got it totally wrong.
