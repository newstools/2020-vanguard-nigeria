The attack on Sunday night at Mondoro resulted in “six deaths, 10 injuries and material damage,” the army said on Twitter. It said soldiers destroyed “two columns of vehicles and motorcycles belonging to the terrorists” during the fightback. “Air strikes launched at night quickly led to major losses of human lives and material of the armed terrorist group,” it said. A local official said the militants had launched the assault “using rocket launchers fired at parked military vehicles”. The official said the clashes lasted for an hour. “I don’t know the number of jihadists killed but there are victims,” the official said. A local association on Monday expressed concern over the possible withdrawal of troops from Mondoro, where one soldier was killed and three others wounded on February 14. The camps at Mondoro and Boulkessi, near the border with Burkina Faso, were targeted in twin attacks in September that left at least 40 soldiers dead. “According to information received, the soldiers are threatening to leave Mondoro… if they execute this decision, the terrorists will take control not only of Mondoro but the entire area of Douentza,” said Oumar Ongoiba, an official with the Association for the Development of Mondoro, underscoring the strategic importance of the zone. The September attacks on Mondoro and Boulkessi were claimed by the GSIM, the main jihadist alliance in the Sahel region affiliated to Al-Qaeda, with which Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita hopes to negotiate.
