England’s top-flight football league, like the rest of world sports, finds itself in the unprecedented peace-time territory as it attempts to react to the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak has infected nearly 800 people so far in Britain. The Premier League moved to shut down until at least April 4 on Friday, joining top leagues in Spain, Italy, Germany and France where fixtures have also been suspended. With no certainty as to when things will return to normal, it has left the 20 clubs in limbo. Liverpool are tantalisingly close to a first title in 30 years and several clubs —- including West Ham —– in the thick of a relegation battle. “The Premier League hopes that an interlude of three weeks from today will enable it to restart but that may well be dreamland. “There is no dodging the possibility that all levels in the English Football League (EFL), as well as the Premier League, will have to be cancelled and this season declared null and void. “This is because, if the players can’t play, the games can’t go ahead,” Brady said in her column in The Sun. Brady says cancelling the Euro 2020 championships could allow more time for the Premier League season to be completed. West Ham, like most teams in the Premier League, have nine games remaining, which even if the suspension is limited to three weeks, presents a huge challenge. This is because the season was originally scheduled to finish on May 17. There are also FA Cup, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League matches to factor in. Premier League chiefs and the clubs will meet to discuss the options next week. The options are not numerous, though. Stopping the season and declaring the current standings as final would be hugely controversial. While few would begrudge Liverpool a first title in 30 years —- they are 25 points ahead of their nearest rivals —- the relegation places are too close to call. Six points separate bottom club Norwich City from West Ham who are in 16th spot, two places above the drop zone. Likewise, nothing is yet decided in the second-tier English Championship’s promotion race. “So, what if the league cannot be finished? “As games in both the Premier League and English Football League are affected, the only fair and reasonable thing to do is declare the whole season null and void. “Who knows who would have gone down or come up if the games have not actually been played in full? “A huge blow to Liverpool who might be robbed of their first title in 30 years,” Brady says. Brighton and Hove Albion’s chief executive Paul Barber said the decision to suspend the league was the only option. “Our priority is to play out the remainder of the season, but we have to be realistic in that we do not know where this virus is heading,” he said.
