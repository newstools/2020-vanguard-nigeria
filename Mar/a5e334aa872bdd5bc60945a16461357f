Mr. Osaigbovo Ehisienmen, the Press Secretary to the Minister, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. Dingyadi condemned in strong terms the attacks on Igabi and Giwa communities in Kaduna State, leading to loss of innocent lives and property. “The ugly incidence will further strengthen the resolve of Nigeria Police and other security agencies to continue the ongoing offensive operation against unrepentant bandits and enemies of Nigeria,” the minister said.
