Speaking at the event, that saw new members inducted into the Society, the chairman of NSE, Apapa branch, Mr. Sunny Ejeje, said the government should work towards making more gas available for use in the power sector. According to Ejeje; “There are huge benefits Nigeria and indeed the manufacturing industry will get through increased utilisation of gas. Similarly, the guest speaker and Head of Technical, Flour Mills, Festus Omotoyinbo, said: “For me, it is a big shame for us as a big gas nation to be in need of gas for power generation. So, as engineers, we are looking at what options could be adopted to provide more gas to power plants, thus enhancing our operations. “Since power cost constitutes more than 40 percent of the total cost of our operations, we have to seek appropriate ways and means of tackling the issue.” Ikeja Electric Plc, Nigeria’s largest Electricity Distribution Company has announced the appointment of Mrs. Folake Soetan as its Acting Chief Executive Officer, effective March 2nd, 2020.
