In a five-page letter written and signed by the Ekiti State chairman of the council of traditional rulers, Alawe of Ilawe, Oba Adebanji Ajibade Alabi to Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde titled: REQUEST TO STOP UNDUE INTERFERENCE OF HIS MAJESTY, OBA LAMIDI ADEYEMI IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF EKITI OBAS, the chairman asked Makinde to stop Alaafin from his “meddlesomeness in the internal affairs of Ekiti Obas.” The letter was evidently a reaction to a previous letter written by the Alaafin of Oyo to Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, on 12 March 2020, with respect to the administration of chieftaincy matters in Ekiti State. The Ilawe queried that the letter from Oba Adeyemi contained a lot of misrepresentation of facts and inaccurate accounts of events between the State Government and the traditional institution in Ekiti State. The Alawe of Ilawe said: “… we, therefore, with all sense of authority and responsibility that the Alaafin goofed to say that from time immemorial that Obaship Lordship had been with the 16 Obas whom he could neither name nor mention. He only pretends not to know that the number of Pelupoelu Obas has never been static.” Read full letter His Excellency,
Engr. ⁨Oluseyi Makinde⁩,
The Governor of Oyo State,
Governor’s Office,
Ibadan. REQUEST TO STOP UNDUE INTERFERENCE OF HIS MAJESTY, OBA LAMIDI ADEYEMI IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF EKITI OBAS. The attention of Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers has been drawn to undue interference of His Majesty Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, The Alaafin of Oyo in the internal affairs of Ekiti Obas through a letter written to Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, dated 12th March 2020 and well-circulated in the social media the following day with respect to the administration of chieftaincy matters in Ekiti State. This is to say the least unbecoming of one of your monarchs in Oyo State. Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers takes strong exception to the whole content of Alaafin’s letter which is absolutely unwarranted as Alaafin cannot superintend over the monarchy in Ekiti State. Ekiti was never and can never be part of the Oyo Empire. It is on this note that Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers is respectfully requesting your Excellency to stop the Alaafin from his meddlesomeness in the internal affairs of Ekiti Obas. (2) The letter of Oba Adeyemi contained a lot of misrepresentation of facts and inaccurate accounts of events between the State Government and the Traditional Institution in Ekiti State which CANNOT be in consultation with, and concurrence of the highly revered and venerable Traditional Rulers mentioned in the letter but who did not sign same. (3) It is a matter of fact and law that Grading, Classification and Composition of Council of Obas in Ekiti State and perhaps anywhere in Nigeria is governed by Law through Government Gazettes even from the Colonial era. From his letter, Alaafin is unable to define what qualifies an Oba to be a PeluPelu Oba. He is not aware of the fact that among the first group of Obas that formed the Association in 1900 were Deji of Akure (Ondo State) and Owalobo of Obo Ayegunle (Kwara State) who have since left the Association. He is also not aware of the fact that some Obas joined the Group in 1909 – Atta Ayede, 1929 (Elemure), 1947 (Alawe, Arajaka, Olujido Ido Ile and Olosi) (Minutes of the Pelupelu meetings for those periods are available) In 1971 Olomuo was admitted to the Pelupelu status by the then Governor of Western State, the Late Gen Adeyinka Adebayo. (4) It should be noted that seventeen (17) Obas are presently laying claim to PeluPelu Obaship in Ekiti State. And by Government Gazette of October 2018, Government recognized twenty-two (22) Obas as PeluPelu in Ekiti and no one raised an eyebrow when Governor Ayo Fayose added the 22nd member, the Oluyin of Iyin – Ekiti in August 2018. What is therefore sacrosanct about the number of pelupelu Obas which Alaafin put at sixteen. (5) We, therefore, say with all sense of authority and responsibility that Alaafin goofed to say that from time immemorial, Obaship Leadership had been within the sixteen (16) Obas who he could neither name nor mention. He only pretends not to know that the number of Pelupoelu Obas has never been static (6) Unfortunately and appallingly, Alaafin stated that his source of information was by “Hearsay” Yet he refused to verify his erroneous fact before falsely accusing Governor Fayemi of neglect. He refused to say those he considers as subordinate Obas. Subordinate to who? (7) Alaafin is no doubt an Oba who enjoys stirring controversies and crisis where there are none. He is, without doubt, a meddlesome interloper who is bent on exporting the crisis he engineered in old Oyo State during which the Traditional Council was unable to hold a single meeting as a result of leadership tussle between him and the OONI of Ife until OSUN was carved out of old Oyo State. (8) Worse still and under him, the Oyo State Council of Traditional Rulers has not held a meeting once in four (4) years under his Chairmanship as a result of his inability to foster peace, unity and cohesion among the Obas. How does he give what he does not have? Ekiti Monarchs are not Alaafin’s AJELES hence his current voyage into internal affairs of Ekiti Obas is highly unwarranted. (9) Ekiti State Council of obas is highly offended by the vituperation poured on our Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi through Alaafin’s unsolicited intervention in purely domestic affairs of our Council. Alaafin has no moral right nor justification to interfere in the matter of Traditional Rulers administration in Ekiti State. (10) The Traditional Council of Obas in Ekiti State is therefore passionately appealing to His Excellency Engr. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to call Alaafin to order and to desist forthwith from meddling in the internal affairs of Ekiti Obas, especially as the matter is pending before a Court of competent jurisdiction. Moreover, the little disagreement amongst Ekiti Obas has not affected the functionality of our Traditional Council. We hold our meetings statutorily unlike the Traditional Council under Alaafin that has long been grounded. (11) It is pertinent to put on record that, Governor Kayode Fayemi met the present classification of Obas on the ground in Ekiti State and has not added one Oba to the class of PeluPelu Obas. The various classifications had been done by previous Administrations through the 1947 Gazette, 1948 Gazette, 1959 Gazette, 2004 Gazette and 2018 Gazette. The present Chairman of Ekiti Traditional Council is listed and classified among the PeluPelu Obas in the Gazette. (12) It is not out of place if in a Council of over Seventy (70) members, only eleven
(11) Obas are aggrieved and have gone to Court. More so that the aggrieved Obas have informed the Court that they are in an “advance stage” of settlement out of Court even though unknown to Government and their Chairman. Why Should Alaafin judge a case without seeking the views of the other party? Why did Alaafin not exercise restraint and caution before writing a letter based on misinformation? The letter of Alaafin to Governor Fayemi is clearly subjudice to the matter in court. (13) We say with all sense of authority and responsibility that Alaafin’s letter is borne out of ignorance. Let him remove the log in his eyes before seeking to remove the speck from others. (14) Finally, the Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers has therefore advised our Governor Dr Kayode Fayemi NOT to dignify Alaafin’s letter with any response because it is clearly ill-motivated and in bad faith. (15) Please accept the assurances of the Highest regards of Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers. HRM OBA ADEBANJI AJIBADE ALABI, AFUNTADE I,
