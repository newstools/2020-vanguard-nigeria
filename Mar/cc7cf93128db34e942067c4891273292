In the new tape, the actress, 33, admits to also “clocking” the 56-year-old “Pirates of the Caribbean” star in the jaw, saying, “I am so sorry … I can remember hitting you as a response to the door thing. And I’m really sorry about hitting you with the door or hitting your head. I did not mean to.” Depp’s lawyers played the audiotape to Heard in August 2016 while she was giving a videotaped deposition in their bitter divorce trial. On the audiotape, Depp is heard saying, “I’d just been hit in the head with a f–king corner of the door … And then I stood up and then you f–king clock me.” Heard responds, “I did not do this thing with the door … [but] I did mean to hit you.” In the deposition, after listening to the audiotape, Heard repeatedly claims that she didn’t purposely slam the door into Depp’s face. “I was trying to escape from a room where Johnny was attacking me … I was trying to get onto the other side of the door, attempting to close the door, and he was attempting to get in, despite my attempts to try to escape an assault.” Of her apology to Depp on the tape, “I made it very clear I was sorry that the door hit him as I went into the room I was … attempting to escape into.” But she told Depp’s lawyers in the deposition that the taped conversation “misrepresents what actually happened, which is him trying to get into a room, which I was trying to get him out of.” The tapes — made by the couple as part of their marital therapy — resurfaced as Depp and Heard prepare to go to court in his defamation lawsuit against her for $50 million after she wrote a Washington Post op-ed about her experience as a victim of domestic violence, without naming him. Heard claimed in their divorce that he repeatedly hit her before and after their February 2015 marriage. Depp strongly denies this, arguing that in fact he was the victim of domestic violence.
