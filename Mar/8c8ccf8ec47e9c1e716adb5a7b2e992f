Recall, Abayomi had on Tuesday, revealed identities of Enwelunta Godfrey and Salami Abiodun Sodiq as two ‘yet-to-be-found’ personalities who had contacts with the index case and called on the public for assistance in locating the identified contacts.

Abayomi, while assuring citizenry on the need not to panic, however, urged them to be very alert. According to the deputy incident commander, “We have tightened surveillance at the nation’s airports because its the first entry point for this virus where a traveller can possibly import it into the country. “We have deployed 60 health workers, comprising of doctors and nurses, in two batches to Murtala Muhammed International Airport in order to complement efforts of the Federal Government in the prevention strategies. “There is no cause for residents to panic, there is just the cause to be alert. We, as Lagosians, this is a common fight and together we will win the battle. Together, we are on a positive and strong foot. “That’s not to say Lagos has it all together, we are just doing our best because we have been on the offensive from the onset.” While commending residents for their support and cooperation since the outbreak of the index case in the state, Abayomi, urged them to continue to be vigilant and keep a high standard of hygiene by regularly watching their hands, avoid crowded areas, report suspicious cases to the authorities and other precautionary measures.
