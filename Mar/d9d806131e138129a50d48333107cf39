He noted that the government needed all the support it could get to prevent the outbreak in the country. Speaking, Julian Idiaghe, Head of Corporate Affairs, FAAN, said that while they had put preventive measures in place to prevent an outbreak, the gesture from Hypo Hygiene Products Limited was commendable. She said that the donation would further assist in promoting excellent hygiene in their facilities. “The health and safety of passengers is highly imperative and by maintaining good hygiene, our other preventive measures are strengthened. “China recorded an outbreak of the deadly transmittable disease now known as Coronavirus (COVID-19), and it has become a global health risk. “The first case was reported in Lagos, Nigeria on Feb. 27, 2020, through an Italian who travelled from Milan to Lagos. “The Federal Government has since encouraged Nigerians to adopt preventive measures by maintaining utmost hygiene to curtail the spread of the virus,” Idiaghe said. She said that screening procedures had also been established, while public health announcements were being made on the importance of imbibing good hygiene.
