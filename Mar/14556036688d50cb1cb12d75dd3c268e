This shouldn’t be a time for questions and answers. Even the strong and powerful countries have been shutdown, and Nigerians are still negotiating and romancing this dreaded virus. “If this country must pass through this fate in the midst of her dirtiness, then we are doomed.” -Femi Peter Giwa, Corps Members “No way!

Shutting down schools is not enough as parents still go to work.” -Fatima Sulaiman, Student Vanguard News Nigeria.
