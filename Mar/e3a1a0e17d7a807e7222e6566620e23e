Sani, who attributed his friend’s behaviour to some sort of diabolism, added that Aplang’s action was not ordinary. “This is not ordinary; Aplang will always confide in me on any issue if he had the plan to walk out on the altar he would have told me. “What happened today is unimaginable, I came out of the church weeping profusely” he added.
