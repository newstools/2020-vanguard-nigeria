He said: “Presently, there are problems in Lagos. In fact, we have serious problems but we shall solve them together. “We are going to solve the problem as one house and not as a divided house. “As the party chairman and other excos have kindly given me a free pass to re-enter the party, I am telling you right now that my job in PDP is to help the efforts to build a winning team that would knock out those people in 2023.”  (NAN)  Vanguard  The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Lagos Governorship Candidate, Mr. Jimi Agbaje’s campaign organization, has urged residents to disregard claim that Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP has endorsed Action Democratic Party, ADP candidate, Babatunde Gbadamosi for the Governorship election in the state.
