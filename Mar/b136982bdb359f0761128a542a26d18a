Sociedad had already won the first leg 2-1 and cemented their spot in the decider when striker Mikel Oyarzabal scored a 41st-minute penalty after a handball in the area by a Mirandes player. The April 18 final in Seville could be an all-Basque affair with Athletic Bilbao defending a 1-0 lead against fellow La Liga mid-table side Granada in their semi-final second leg on Thursday. Mirandes were attempting to become the first-second division club to reach the final since 1980. Real Sociedad, who were Copa del Rey winners in 1909 and 1987 and knocked out Real Madrid 4-3 in this seasonâ€™s quarter-finals, will be playing in their first final since 1988 when they lost 1-0 to Barcelona. With 23 titles, Athletic Bilbao are second on the all-time list of Cup winners behind Barcelona who have triumphed 30 times.
