Many people buy second-hand clothes sent from Europe, North America, and China, which they prefer because they are more affordable than new products. A significant number of Kenyans with low-incomes depend on the mitumba business for their livelihoods. But the government has been keen to discourage these imports in support of local industries. On Wednesday, Ms. Maina met second-hand clothes dealers and encouraged them to source goods from local manufacturers. But not everyone is happy with the suspension. The MP for Kamukunji sub-county, where the bustling clothes market of Eastleigh is situated, tweeted his opposition, saying he was shocked by the move, as reported by BBC. vanguard RWANDA is a small landlocked African country with a 24,670 square kilometer, a population of 11.9 million and a GDP of $8.9 Billion.
