Ighalo’s temporary move from Shanghai Shenhua, according to Sportsmail, is set to end a month earlier than most loan deals.

Either way, there is already a willingness at Old Trafford to sign Ighalo permanently after the former Watford striker scored four goals in his first eight matches. Shanghai are prepared to sell Ighalo and have put a £15m valuation on the player, who will be 31 in June.

Discussing his contract situation at the weekend, Ighalo said: ‘Talking about other things now would not only be selfish but terribly insensitive. ‘The challenge before us is not a football one, but a global one. You can’t put football before health challenges.’ After United’s win against LASK earlier this month, Solskjaer gave an indication that United were interested in making Ighalo’s move permanent. ‘He will improve and get better,’ said the United boss. ‘He has the qualities we saw in him that we needed.
