I’m sure I would have let you know if something was wrong! Falling while performing ‘I Fall Apart’ guys.” On Friday, a video of Malone falling onstage during a performance of “I Fall Apart” and a separate video of him rolling his eyes during “Rockstar” circulated online, sparking concern that the singer was using drugs. “I’m not trying to assume anything, but he looks like he’s under drugs,” one person tweeted. “We lost too many artists over overdoses. I hope he’s gonna be okay.” However, earlier this week, Malone told GQ he quit smoking marijuana after a “pot-induced anxiety attack” and now likes to consume “nothing stronger than alcohol.” New York Post Vanguard News Estranged husband of Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe, Lanre Gentry has denied the domestic violence allegation levelled against him after the photos of the battered face of his wife, Mercy Aigbe went viral on the internet over the weekend.
