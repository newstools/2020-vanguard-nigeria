Dr. Mohammad Abubakar, the Minister of Environment, made this known while briefing newsmen on the  Environmental Health Response to COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria on Tuesday in Abuja. According to Abubakar, the ministry is taking this measure to support the Ministry of Health’s containment strategy against the disease. He said that the large pool of Environmental Health Volunteers would be mobilised for this purpose. The minister said the EHO would be deployed to public places, including markets, schools, motor parks, train stations, and similar places would be put under surveillance. Abubakar said that based on the foregoing, the Nigerian response needs to be comprehensive, multistakeholder and multisectoral in nature learning from countries presently at war with the novel COVID-19. “International best practices of instituting cordon sanitaire and social distancing in our communities where needed will be utilised to limit contact of people with those that may be infected with the viral disease. “In the same vein, environmental decontamination and disinfection shall be undertaken in high exposure areas with a view of killing the enveloped viruses,” he said. He, however, urged the ministry of the environment at the state level to be proactive and key into the preparedness in their respective states. “I hereby charge EHO in states and local ports to engage butchers to ensure they do not handle, slaughter, dress and prepare meats originating from wild animals or sick livestock which have died from unknown causes.” He also advised Nigerians to regularly wash their hands, cover their mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing. vanguard The World Health Organization, WHO, last Tuesday, announced that countries should begin to prepare for pandemic following the rapid spread of coronavirus in the world.
