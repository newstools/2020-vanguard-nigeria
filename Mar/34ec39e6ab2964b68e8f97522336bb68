The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, stated this during a press conference held on Sunday in Abuja. Ologbondiyan said that while the apex court had maintained that its decision were final in the earlier calls for review, the PDP had also stood by the decision of the court. “Our position in the PDP is that since the Supreme Court has declared that its decisions are final, Nigerians have come to accept it as such. “But if the apex court, by any way or measure, goes after Zamfara for a review, PDP will be forced to seek for review of other elections that we believed were not fair on our side,” Ologbondiyan said.(NAN) VANGUARD By Dirisu Yakubu - Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP On Friday reiterated its position that the Supreme Court has no option but to dismiss the application by the All Progressives Congress, APC, to review its judgment on the Zamfara governorship election matter.
