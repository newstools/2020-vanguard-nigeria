Soumaila Cisse and his entourage are believed to have been kidnapped during an election campaign in a region where terrorists frequently carry out attacks. Cisse lost presidential polls to incumbent Ibrahim Boubakar Keita in 2013 and in 2018. A URD statement on Thursday said none of the group had been reachable since late afternoon on Wednesday, at a time they were expected to reach the village of Koumaira in the northern region of Timbuktu. The party’s statement referred to the incident as a kidnapping but did not give any further details as to who may have been behind it. “Still no news of him or his delegation,” URD Vice President Madani Traore told Reuters. The party said it has set up a crisis committee and urged the government, military and U.N. peacekeepers to help find the missing group.
