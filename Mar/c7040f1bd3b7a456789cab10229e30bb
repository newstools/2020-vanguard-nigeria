Insisting that he was still in a good relationship with Chocolate city, the  bad belle crooner,  said “If there is one thing I would say, it is that Nigeria is a very hard country for somebody that cares about musicians to be in. Because at the end of the day, when you really think about it, the Banky W’s are leaving the music business. These are people that have nurtured artistes.” On why he left Chocolate City, MI said: “.”Chocolate City is family. It is time for me to do a new thing musically.
