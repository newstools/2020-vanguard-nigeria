The deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, has left Awe, Nasarawa State, his abode after he left Kano on Monday. Sanusi left Awe at about 4:27 p.m., in company of Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, after observing the Friday congregational prayers. Sanusi had led the Friday Juma’at prayer at the Awe Central Mosque, where he admonished Muslims to take whatever situation they found themselves in, as destiny. He encouraged the faithful to always live with the fear of God and accept whatever predicament that befell them in good faith, and prayed for the peace and development of the country.

Efforts to confirm Sanusi’s destination did not yield fruits, but an authoritative source said that the former monarch left Awe “to enjoy his freedom”. “You remember that a Federal High Court in Abuja gave an order directing his immediate release from confinement. The man is now free and should be allowed to be free,” he said.
