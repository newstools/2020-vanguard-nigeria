La Liga and the RFEF said matches in the top two divisions will only resume when the Spanish government decide there is no longer any health risk. Fixtures had previously been suspended for two weeks from March 12 but there was no expectation they would restart this weekend, with the crisis continuing to escalate. The total number of deaths due to coronavirus in Spain passed 2,000 on Sunday, making it the third worst-affected country in the world, behind only Italy and China. The Spanish government declared a state of alarm on March 14 and intends to extend the lockdown imposed on the population until at least April 11. A joint statement from La Liga and the RFEF read: “The Monitoring Commission established by the current RFEF-La Liga Coordination Agreement agrees the suspension of professional football competitions until the authorities of the Government of Spain and the General Administration of the State consider they can be resumed without creating any health risk.” VANGUARD Real Madrid went into quarantine on Thursday as La Liga announced Spain's top two divisions will be suspended for at least two weeks over the coronavirus.
