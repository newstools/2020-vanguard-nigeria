With no reverse repos maturing on Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China injected a total of 200 billion yuan (about 28.3 billion U.S. dollars) into the market. This was revealed on the website of the central bank. The funds included 90 billion Yuan through seven-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.2 per cent and 110 billion Yuan of 14-day contract at an interest rate of 2.35 per cent. The move is intended to maintain stable liquidity in the banking system, the central bank said.
