Oba Akanbi pointed having stun gun or pepper spray is temporal protection against rape, calling on the Nigerian government to permit females access to the two items as an immediate rescue in the hands of rapists. Condemning the incessant cases of raping that have permeated our society, Oluwo said there is need for the urgent protective measure to curtail the menace. A statement released by Oluwo’s press secretary, Alli Ibraheem, stated the call becomes necessary to safe females lives who were raped and killed. He hinted the need for the Federal Government to safe more lives through licensed of defence items such as stun gun and pepper spray for the exclusive use of females. He suggested stun gun and pepper spray could form part of females accessories on their handbag and purse as a defence for unapproved sexual attempts. “The reported cases of raping is alarming and call for a serious concert by responsible stakeholders. Apart from a constitutional penalty against rapists, I want to charge the government to consider the legalisation of the use of stun guns and pepper spray by females as protective items against unapproved sexual attempts. “Many ladies were raped and killed. I’ve strong trust that the items, when approved for females will protect them against such an unjust treatment and return sanctity to our society” “By that, the constitutional provision is a long term punishment while pepper spray and stun gun are short term defence measure. The defence instruments could form part of females’ accessories in their handbags and purses. “The spate of reoccurrences is unassuming. It must be checkmated through further constitutional legislations to invite sanity to our society and respect the dignity of Nigerian females. “There are training sessions available overseas even in South Africa for females to learn how to use it in warding off attackers. “Rapists are coward animals and not human. The trauma of their victims is an eternal curse of no remedy. Raped victims are no doubt mentally disturbed and emotional imbalance. When done with mutual consent and agreement, the two enjoin and enjoy in merriment “Raped victims should not be ashamed. Talk about it and you shall be assisted. It is never the end of life. Though, an ugly experience but should be shared overtly or covertly to unravel and penalize offenders and serve as a deterrent to others. A problem shared is a problem solved. If shared, many ladies will learn to prevent similar experience while the likes of perpetrators are warned against such” “The perpetrators should not take advantage of a lady visiting your home. Even, a responsible husband and wife seek each others consent before engaging in sex. No lady deserves to be forced for sex. Sex is dignity and should be respected through mutual consent by both genders. Nigerian government should enforce a penalty against rapists. Legislators can come up with stricter legislation to protect the pride of Nigerian females and approve the use of defence items. Doing such will speak sense to greedy sexual men and restore normalcy” Oluwo enjoined Nigerians to respect each other’s dignity and toe the path of honour on mutual agreement on sexual intercourse.
