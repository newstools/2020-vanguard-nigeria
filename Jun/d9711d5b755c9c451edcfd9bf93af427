According to him, the huge claims paid during the period had a negative impact on the bottom line as profit before tax came down from N2.6 billion to N1.9 billion, a decrease of 29 percent. However, profit after tax increased from N2 billion to N2.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent due to deferred tax asset. Smart said: “With a very strong foundation and brand reputation, we are well-positioned to move to the next level even as we continue to delight all our stakeholders.” Also speaking at the AGM, Chairman of the company, Dr. Fidelis  Ayebae, said that the company has been working diligently to assess the potential risks posed by COVID-19 to its business on an ongoing basis and to realign its strategies accordingly. He said: “Notwithstanding that the company remains well positioned and its business strong, given the unprecedented circumstances and current market environment, the company has adopted policies which are prudent at this time to grow its market share by leveraging extensively on its robust technology infrastructure and maintain a healthy balance sheet.” Vanguard DESPITE optimism on the part of operators that the insurance sector could reverse into profit territory in the first half of 2019, H1’19, the sector sustained profit decline.
