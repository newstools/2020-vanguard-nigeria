Their work is based on computer simulations of the reservoirs below the ice-shell surface of Europa, one of the largest moons in the solar system. Calculations by scientists at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California indicate this global ocean could have been formed by breakdown of minerals that contain water. Their work, which is not yet peer-reviewed, was presented at the virtual 2020 Goldschmidt geochemistry conference. The researchers developed their model using data from Nasa’s Galileo mission and the Hubble Space Telescope, which was built by Nasa and the European Space Agency. In 2016, Hubble uncovered tantalising evidence of water vapour plumes erupting from the surface of Europa. Findings suggest ocean worlds such as Europa can be formed by metamorphism, a change in the composition or structure of rocks by heat, pressure or other natural phenomenon. The scientists believe heating and increased pressure, possibly caused by natural radioactive processes or tidal movement generated by Jupiter’s gravity, would result in the breakdown of water-containing minerals to release trapped water. They also found that this ocean would “originally have been mildly acidic, with high concentrations of carbon dioxide, calcium and sulphate”, before becoming “chloride rich”.
