Be it the action packed games, adrenaline fueled racing games or even the heavily thought out real-time strategy games, mobile gamers today need a smartphone that can deliver top-notch performance while also keeping the price point in mind. The new HUAWEI Y7p is all set to create an immersive gaming experience, making it the ultimate smartphone for the modern gamer. Here’s how. One of the key factors for an immersive gaming experience is the display. The HUAWEI Y7p comes with a 6.39-inch HUAWEI Punch FullView FHD+ display with a resolution of 1560 x 720, paving the way for crystal clear graphics without missing out even the tiniest detail. However, what really contributes to the gaming experience is the bezel-less design. By removing the massive notch and reducing bezels, gamers are given much more screen estate to game on. This means important parts of the game are not squeezed into corners or hard to access due to any bezels or notches. By moving the front camera to the corner in a 4.5mm wide punch hole, it stays out of the way during gaming, paving the way for a more immersive and uninterrupted gaming session. Apart from enhancing the gaming experience, having a good display also means a better way to watch the latest game trailer or new game streams on the go. What powers this enhanced gaming experience is the Kirin 710F octa-core processor with EMUI 9.1 on-board. Not only does this ensure smooth and power efficient gaming, but thanks to advanced features like Extendable Read-Only File System (EROFS) and Full Scene Acceleration technology, you are promised even better system performance. This is further supported by 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which you can expand to 512GB with an extra micro SD card. Gamers need not worry about running out of charge either, thanks to the 4000mAh battery with AI power saving which can keep the HUAWEI Y7p running for long sessions of intensive gaming. Further improving your gaming experience is the GPU Turbo 3.0 feature, which boosts gaming performance and enhances graphics for a more immersive gaming experience. You gaming immersion is made complete with HUAWEI 9.1 SKY stereo sound which optimizes the audio as well. Be it action, adventure, sports or even casual games, the HUAWEI Y7p promises superior gaming performance with them all. Pairing a stunning display for an immersive gaming experience with solid hardware for a smooth gaming performance, the HUAWEI Y7p is easily one of the best choices for today’s smartphone gamer.
