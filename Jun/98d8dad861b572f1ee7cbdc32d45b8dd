The donation, which was presented to the state by representatives of the Interswitch Group, was received by the Commissioner for Transport, Dr. Frederick Oladeinde, on behalf of the Governor at Alausa, Ikeja, recently. This is part of Interswitch’s on-going support for the numerous local intervention initiatives between state governments and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Speaking at the donation ceremony, Divisional CEO, Interswitch Financial Inclusion Services Limited (IFIS), Titilola Shogaolu, said that as the coronavirus continues to spread across the country with increasing numbers of reported cases, it is imperative to increase the testing capacity in Nigeria. She reaffirmed Interswitch’s commitment towards supporting governments at all levels in the fight against the deadly pandemic. Shogaolu disclosed that Interswitch, through its health-tech subsidiary, eClat, has developed a COVID-19 pathway software platform. “The platform allows members of the public to perform remote self-assessment exercise to determine their risk status and pre-disposition to the virus. The platform analyses users’ information from a series of questions around risk factors, recent exposure, observed symptoms, health and travel history. Users are thereafter advised whether to self-quarantine, visit a healthcare facility for further testing, or just keep safe. She added that the self-assessment platform is being deployed across the 23 states in Nigeria. Currently, the platform has been deployed in eight states, with unique USSD codes. Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, Hon. Commissioner for Transportation, Lagos State, commended Interswitch Group for the donation of the protective equipment and test kits.
