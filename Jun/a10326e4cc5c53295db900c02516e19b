Egbo who played 12 matches with the Eagles from 1999 to 2002 is currently the head coach of Albanian side KF Tirana who are on the verge of winning a European champions league qualification spot. He said that the coaches and indeed Nigerian fans need to be patient with the goalkeepers currently in the national team. “I have seen some recent Super Eagles games. Goalkeepers are not like football players. Give one an opportunity and start using him, just like they did with Enyeama, for me the best goalkeeper Nigeria has produced. “Akpeyi is a good goalkeeper. Nigeria sometimes lacks patience. We need to have confidence in our goalkeepers. We should not crucify them when they make mistakes because they are human beings,” Egbo told allnigeriasoccer.com Vanguard Even as the debate on the decision by Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr to hire a new goalkeepers' trainer for the team rages on, Alloy Agu who has been the head of goalkeeping department in the team has boasted that he remains the best in that respect. July 29, 2017 In "News" Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu said that he has hope that Vincent Enyeama will make a strong comeback to the national team when he regains full fitness.
