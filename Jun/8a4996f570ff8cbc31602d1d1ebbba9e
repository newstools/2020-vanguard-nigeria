But the reigning Premier League champions are set to appeal the ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport over the course of three days next week.

But it is claimed that “if he becomes available, United will go for him” – even though he is “much likelier” to go to the Bernabeu. Sterling’s agent Aidy Ward made it clear a few months ago that Sterling intends to stay at the Etihad. He said: “Raheem is solely focused on Manchester City and will not be distracted by any talk of transfers to any club at the moment.” Back in February, Sterling was asked about the possibility of joining Real in the future but said “right now” he is happy at City.
