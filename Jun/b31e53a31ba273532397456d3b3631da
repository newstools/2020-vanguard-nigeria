King Leopold, considered a ruthless robber baron by historians, was eventually forced out of the Congo due to his atrocities. Joseph Conrad wrote his 1902 horror novel, “The Heart of Darkness” based on the Congo during Leopold’s rule — and brought to light the atrocities committed. Six years after the publication of Conrad’s book and an international outcry over abuses, King Leopold was forced out of the Congo. “There must be an acknowledgement that this was a problem in certain aspects,” Joachim Coens, chairman of the Flemish Christian Democrats, told the broadcaster VRT. Coens suggested the King himself should comment on his grandfather’s misdeeds.
