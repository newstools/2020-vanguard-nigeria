She said the man offered to give her a ride back to a church where she had sought “refuge” because of “unjust living conditions.” “He came disguised as a man of God and ended up picking me up from nearby Saxon Street,” she tweeted. “I trusted the holy spirit to keep me safe.” She said that the man exposed himself to her after offering her a shower, and later started rubbing her back and body “before he climaxed.” Anyways I was molested in Tallahassee, Florida by a black man this morning at 5:30 on Richview and Park Ave. The man offered to give me a ride to find someplace to sleep and recollect my belongings from a church I refuged to a couple days back to escape unjust living conditions. — Oluwatoyin (@virgingrltoyin) June 6, 2020  Salau said she called police after the assault happened.
