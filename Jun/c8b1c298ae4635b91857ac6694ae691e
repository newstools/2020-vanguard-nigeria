The 23-year-old academy graduate made his debut in 2017 and has made 75 appearances for the side, scoring six goals. “Whilst I understand that we all have so many other things to think about at the moment, I’m so happy to sign this contract and play a part in the future ahead for this team,” the Scotland international said. “All I have ever known is United and I hope that my passion for the club shows every time I go onto the pitch. I’ll continue to give everything for this club whenever I pull on the shirt.” McTominay has made 28 appearances in all competitions this season, despite missing two months due to a knee injury, and has been one of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s standout players. “Scott has done tremendously well since I joined and has been a vital part of our midfield,” the United boss said. “He brings determination, tenacity and skill to the game and we know that Scott’s attributes will be a major asset to the squad over the coming years.” VANGUARD Jose Mourinho says Zlatan Ibrahimovic has "won the right to choose his future" after acknowledging that the striker is likely to leave Manchester United at the end of the season.
