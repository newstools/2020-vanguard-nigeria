In a bid to mop up liquidity and prevent speculation in the foreign exchange market, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Friday deducted N216 billion from banks accounts as Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) . In addition, the apex bank mopped up N80 billion through sale of secondary market (Open Market Operations, OBB) treasury bills. These developments prompted the cost of funds to rise sharply on Friday with interest rate on Collateralised (Open Buy Back, OBB) lending rising by 740 basis points (bpts) to 15.17 percent from 8.3 percent the previous week. Similarly, interest rate on Overnight lending rose by 684 bpts to 16.67 percent on Friday from 9.83 percent the previous week.
