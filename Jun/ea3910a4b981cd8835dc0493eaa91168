Coach Gernot Rohr said he extended his contract with Nigeria because he has an unfinished business with the Super Eagles of Nigeria, one of which is a fourth Africa Cup of Nations triumph Rohr, 66, extended his stay in Nigeria till 2022 after he agreed to a pay cut in the local currency and reside in the country. The German-born coach will according to reports earn $49,000 a month instead of the $55,000 stipulated in his previous contract and he will live in Nigeria for at least 10 months a year. “This is a special job because this is my team, I built it with my staff,” the former Niger and Gabon coach said Monday on local television. “It’s a very young team, but the mission is not finished yet, so we want to continue. “We all have to make sacrifices and I will be the first.” The target for Rohr is to be champions of Africa again. The Super Eagles have won the Africa Cup of Nations three times — in 1980, 1994 and 2013. “Let’s qualify for (the Nations Cup) and then we want to win it,” he said. “We have a good team, we’re now number three in Africa. When I arrived (in 2016), we were number 13. “We have worked together for the past four years and I hope we can progress.”  Rohr led Nigeria to third place at last year’s Africa Cup in Egypt, where they lost 2-1 to eventual champions Algeria in the semi-finals after conceding a stoppage-time goal. His team top their qualifying group for the 2021 Nations Cup slated for Cameroon with six points after winning their first two games against second-placed Benin and Lesotho, who are third. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1399723" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=194%2C194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?resize=130%2C130&amp;ssl=1 130w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohr-Stats.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Sierra Leone are the other team in the group and are bottom on a point.
