It has a negative impact on health or functioning and may take the form of drug dependence or be part of a wider spectrum of problematic or harmful behaviour (Department of Health, 2006). At the moment there seems to be an increased risk of self-medication and drug misuse especially in countries where prescription-only medicines could be bought without a prescription. For instance, countries like Nigeria where some patent medicines dealers who are meant to sell GSL medicines end up dispensing pharmacy-only medicines and prescription-only medicines. As soon as a new drug for managing COVID-19 is announced by mainstream media, people run off to the shops to buy these drugs, even people who have not tested positive for the coronavirus, indulge in self-medication in a bid to prevent contracting the virus. I am worried about the recent announcement for Dexamethasone as a new drug for treating COVID 19. Information reaching me shows, following hours of announcing this drug by the media, some Nigerian residents have started trooping to their pharmacy, ‘chemist’ and illegal drug dealers to buy dexamethasone tablets. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid, it has high glucocorticoid activity, and it should not be used without the guidance of a clinician. According to the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC), depending on the dose and duration of therapy, adrenocortical insufficiency caused by glucocorticoid therapy can continue for several months and in individual cases more than a year after cessation of therapy. Through immunosuppression, treatment with Dexamethasone can lead to an increased risk of bacterial, viral, parasitic, opportunistic, and fungal infections. It can mask the symptoms of an existing or developing infection, thereby making a diagnosis more difficult. Latent infections, like tuberculosis or hepatitis B, can be reactivated. Dexamethasone also has some side effects; the following side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30 percent) for patients taking dexamethasone: *Increased appetite *Irritability *Difficulty sleeping (insomnia) *Swelling in your ankles and feet (fluid retention) *Heartburn *Muscle weakness *Impaired wound healing *Increased blood sugar levels If only the media companies understood the fact that prescription-only medicines could be bought without prescription in some countries, they would tread carefully and choose appropriate wording when announcing potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment. It’s the duty of the Ministry of health and drug regulatory bodies of those countries where prescription medication could be bought in the market like sweets to continue to create awareness, educate the general public on the dangers of self-medication, drug misuse, and drug abuse. They must not relent in their efforts of managing drug distribution/regulation. My advice to people living in countries where you could buy prescription-only medicines without a prescription is this: Do not run off to buy the latest drug announced for COVID-19 treatment. This drug is a corticosteroid and should only be taken if prescribed by a clinician. Please do not indulge in medication misuse and abuse. It could lead to adverse effects or even death. vanguard The word “poison” may evoke thoughts of murder and mayhem, but for centuries, healers and scientists have harnessed the power of natural poisons, toxins, and venoms, as medicine.
