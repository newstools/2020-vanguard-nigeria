This Executive Director, Research and Advocacy of the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, ANED, Barrister Sunday Oduntan, who made the plea via a statement issued Sunday in Abuja, argued that the cost of gas remains one of the key determinants of the electricity tariff in Nigeria. Barrister Oduntan noted that “Most of Nigeria’s power generating plants are thermal plants. They use gas as their fuel and as long as the price of gas is high, the cost of generation – and the eventual tariff to the end-user – will also be high. “At present, the energy generation mix is around 80 per cent thermal and 20 per cent hydro. More so, the cost of gas is also affected by fluctuations in forex. “So, while the cost of gas (and generation) will rise due to forex fluctuations, the tariff is fixed in Naira and may not account for this difference especially because of the absence of a commitment to adhering to periodic tariff reviews. “As we all know, today, the price of gas for local power production is a little over three dollars for one million British Thermal Units (mmbtu). Meanwhile, in this same country, the cost at which LNG exports gas is less than half the same amount. “If you also consider that some of these IOCs are still flaring this much-needed gas into the atmosphere, you will realise that there are many options available to the government to intervene through in the quest to make electricity more affordable. “This cost of gas presently accounts for almost 70 per cent of all the input the plants utilise to generate power. Except we begin to consider solutions from that angle, we may not make much headway in providing the cheap electricity Nigerians need to move the country to an industrial giant.” He stressed further that, The absence of a market-reflective tariff has continued to bedevil the sector and is presently responsible for most of the N1.5tn liquidity gap that has been threatening to derail the power sector reforms for years. “Also, with effect from July 1, a new performance-driven increased tariff structure is set for implementation as a step towards narrowing the liquidity gap. “If the cost of the major input in any production process is reduced, it will have a ripple effect across the entire chain. That is what we are advocating for. It will be in the interest of the end-users and by implication, the Nigerian economy as a whole.” Vanguard NIGERIANS are inundated   from time to time by media reports of impending electricity tariff review to the extent that the National Assembly has had cause to invite the Minister of Works, Housing and Power to defend the purported move. Periodic tariff review is an essential part of the Electric Power… May 1, 2018 In "News" The Federal Government’s efforts to supply 4,000 megawatts, MW, of electricity by December 2017, may not be accomplished as a result of poor state of power stations, limited transmission facilities and inadequate distribution in the nation. June 27, 2017 In "Energy" With the successful handing over of Electricity Generation Companies, GENCOs, and Electricity Distribution Companies, DISCOs, to private investors in 2013, many observers were very optimistic that the era of epileptic power supply will be over in Nigeria at least for a reason. The way forward was clearly charted while the… August 24, 2018 In "News"
