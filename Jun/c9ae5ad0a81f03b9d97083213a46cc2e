Rising from a crucial emergency meeting, a few days back, the guild among other things resolved to investigate, probe, and determine deterrent penalties and punitive measures for offenders. It also seeks and supports every initiative of well-meaning industry stakeholders to curb the menace of sexual harassment, rape, and sex for roles. In a memo signed by the National Secretary of DGN, Uche Agbo, the guild has equally opened a dedicated 24/7 confidential email address to entertain reports, petitions, and complaints in addition to raising an Intra-Guild campaign to educate our members on the implications of such barbaric acts and participate in Inter Guild activities to stop rape and sexual harassment in Nollywood. Members of the committee include Pat Oghre(Chairman), Remix Ibinola(Secretary) , Tope Oshin, Francis Onwochei, and Tony Akposheri.
