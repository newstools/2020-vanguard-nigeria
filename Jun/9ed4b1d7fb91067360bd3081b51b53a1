Prices have plummeted over falling demand as countries around the world have imposed strict lockdowns to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Under the terms of the April agreement, OPEC and the so-called OPEC+ countries pledged to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) from May 1 until the end of June.
