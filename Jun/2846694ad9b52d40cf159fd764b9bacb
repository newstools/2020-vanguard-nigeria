Meanwhile, a handful of sympathisers gathered at the Oluyole residence of the former governor, there were no signs that any member of his family was around. Olubadan said, ” it is not in Yoruba custom and tradition for a father to announce the obituary of his son. This is the dilemma of His Majesty, Oba Sali Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1, Olubadan of Ibadanland in respect of the exit of the immediate past Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi”. “Words are not enough to describe the untimely exit of former Governor Ajimobi, an illustrious son and Aare of Ibadanland. One recalls that the last time Kabiyesi and Ajimobi met was at Ibadan House, Oke Aremo sometimes in February, this year. A wall of fame built in honour of some illustrious Ibadan indigenes had been erected just before the outbreak of COVID-19. Nobody had the slightest idea that death would come calling to him so quickly. Ajimobi was vibrant and full of life on that occasion. Our prayer has always been that our children should outlive us. But, who are we to challenge the sovereignty of Almighty God who gives and takes without question?” The former Minister of Communication, Dr. Adebayo Shittu, wrote  “I received the news of the death of my brother, Senator Ishaq Abiola Ajimobi, the former Governor of Oyo State with a rude shock. He was a very great, eloquent, and quintessential leader. His services to our dear Oyo State, Nigeria, and our Party cannot be forgotten in a hurry. I sincerely condole with his family, especially his amiable Wife and Children; the Government and the good people of Oyo State”. In his own condolence message, Dr. Olapade Agoro, former presidential candidate of National Action Council, said, “It can be well said of Isaq Abiola that he came, he saw and did his best although like a bulldozer unavoidably hurting a lot of people in the course of duty. His style of “Bull Dozer Governance” covering a period of eight years loaded with beyond the usual developmental strides can be said would stand”.
