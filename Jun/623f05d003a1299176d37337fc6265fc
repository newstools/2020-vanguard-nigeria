The Arsenal captain is set to enter the final year of his deal at the Emirates Stadium with talks about renewed terms at an impasse. Aubameyang has been prolific for Arsenal since signing from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, scoring 49 Premier League goals in 75 top-flight appearances. But the Gabon striker is yet to lift silverware with Arsenal and Aubameyang, who has been linked with the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, hinted that his ambitions for trophies must be matched before he commits to a new contract. “Recently I have not received an offer to extend,” he told Telefoot. “But, of course, we have had exchanges with the club for a fair few months now. “They know very well why so far nothing has happened. They have the keys. It is up to them to do their work and, after that, we will see how things go. “It is a turning point in my career, and I will be very frank with everyone.
