The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development had earlier announced the commencement of enrolment for a new batch of N-Power beneficiaries effective June 26, 2020. According to a statement by the ministry, “the N-Power Programme has enrolled 500,000 beneficiaries thus far – 200,000 from Batch A which started in September 2016 and 300,000 from Batch B which kicked off in August 2018. “The beneficiaries were supposed to spend not less than 24 months on the programme and were spread across the key industries targeted by the program – Agriculture, Health, Education, and Tax. “The current beneficiaries from Batches A and B are scheduled to transit the programme by July 31, 2020, with plans already in place to transition them into entrepreneurship.” N-power programme was inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 under the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) with the mandate of lifting citizens out of poverty through capacity building, investment, and direct support. The programme is targeted at unemployed Nigerians between the ages of 18-35 to “contribute in building a skilled Nigerian workforce”. Unemployed Nigerians with a secondary school leaving certificates according to N-Power can apply for “N-Power Agro, N-Power Build, N-Power Creative and N-Power Tech,” While only graduates are allowed to apply for N-Power Teach and N-Power Health. Disregarding ersatz websites and fake agents, N-Power has advised the general public not to pay anyone to apply on the N-Power portal. N-Power also reiterated that the portal will be opened by 11:45 pm and that all registrations with “successful” pop-up prior to 11:45pm are invalid. “Dear Intending N-Power 2020 Applicants, Here is how to prepare for the N-Power application.
