Vanguard earlier reported that the Chief Executive Officer of the company, Dr Sam Iwuajoku in a statement apologized to the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika for the company’s involvement in the Naira Marley breach of the federal government lockdown order.

I didn’t know that it was a bunch of useless people. “We are very sorry for this mistake and we promise that this would not happen again.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1409896" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?resize=400%2C507&#038;ssl=1" alt="Naira Marley and ExecuJet" width="400" height="507" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?resize=808%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 808w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?resize=768%2C973&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?resize=46%2C58&amp;ssl=1 46w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?resize=153%2C194&amp;ssl=1 153w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ExecuJet-statement.jpeg?resize=103%2C130&amp;ssl=1 103w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The musician irked by the use of ‘useless people’ to describe him and others who were on the flight took to twitter to debunk the claim of ignorance by the company.
