The deficit will largely be financed from new borrowings estimated at N4.17 Trillion. It is expected that N1.98 Trillion of the new borrowings will be from external (multilateral) concessional sources, mainly the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank and Islamic Development Bank. New Domestic debts totalling about N593.89 Billion will also be sourced for the 2020 budget. In addition, N126.04 Billion will be derived from Privatization proceeds, N263.63 Billion will be sourced from the Federal Government’s Special Accounts to fund Covid-19 expenditures, and M387.30 Billion will be drawn down on multilateral/bilateral loans secured for specific development projects. “The deficit is currently 3.55% to GDP which exceed the ceiling of (3% of GDP) stipulated in section 12(i) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007 (as amended). Further to the above section, Section 12(ii) stated that aggregate expenditure for the financial year may exceed the ceiling imposed by the provisions if in the opinion of the President there is a clear and present threat to National Security or Sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “The Covid-19 crisis has posed a threat to National Security within the contemplation of the FRA 2007. That the reduction in Customs budgeted revenue figure from N1.5 Trillion to N950 Billion be sustained, but with serious monitoring and supervision by the Customs with a view of blocking all revenue leakages in the system. “That the first-line NNPC deductions from the federally funded project be approved, as the Federal Government position of the reduction which represents 42.8% of the overall savings amount to N360 Trillion go straight to the revenue coffers of the Federal Government for the funding of the 2020 amended budget. “That the NNPC works on the various cost components, with a view to minimizing the production cost per barrel, and should take action on the Petroleum Industry Bill. That the non-oil revenue which includes the Capital Gaines Tax, Stamp Duty and Company Income Tax be sustained as contained in the proposed MTEF/FSP amendment with serious supervision with a view of blocking revenue leakages within the system.” In his remarks after the adoption of the report, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan urged the Senate Committee on Privatization to liaise with the Bureau of Public Enterprise ( BPE) to ensure that the projected N260billion from proceeds of privatized agencies was realised and accordingly used to fund the budget. Lawan who frowned at some of the special accounts being kept by the executive, particularly the Natural Resources Development Accounts, said that such accounts at this time of scarcity of funds to finance the budget are not all that necessary, adding, “Keeping monies in Natural Resources Development Accounts is more of waste than serving critical purposes.” He thereafter adjourned sitting of the Senate to Tuesday next week for consideration and possible passage of the revised N10.509 trillion 2020 budget.
