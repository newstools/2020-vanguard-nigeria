This is essential because decay or entropy is one of nature’s laws and no one is above these laws. However, I have seen time and again that the people who take responsibility for their own healing are the ones that heal the fastest. The ones who consider their ailment to also be a message and chance of improvement are the ones that overcome it the quickest. In today’s world, people are so busy with their lives that no one takes care of their health and they suffer from various diseases. Fistula is being one of the most common diseases these days. Planet Ayurveda provides Ayurvedic treatment for Anal Fistula. Anal Fistula or Fistula-in-Ano is a small tunnel that develops between the end of the bowel and the skin near the anus (where poo leaves the body). They are usually the result of an infection near the anus causing a collection of pus (abscess) in the nearby tissue. Sometimes an anal fistula works its way from an internal gland to the outside of the skin surrounding the anus; and on the skin, this looks like an open boil. Ayurveda is thousands of years old system of holistic healing through herbs. It is not only based on drugs but on a healthy diet, a good lifestyle, staying happy, and different Ayurvedic treatments which have no side effects and are absolutely safe to use. According to Ayurveda a body suffers from a disorder because of disproportion in the 3 Doshas. Ayurveda deals with balancing the Doshas and healing the body. Synchronizing the body, lifestyle with nature, and its paradigm. The Doshas have to be balanced to lead a healthy life. Here, we will talk about fistula in Ano and fistula treatment in Ayurveda. Anal Fistula is a two-sided canal. One end of the tube opens up inside the anal canal and the other opening is near the anus on the skin. When there is an infection in the anal canal a track is built from where there is oozing of pus leading to discomfort, pain, and sometimes fever as well. Ayurvedic herbs are especially known for keeping the digestive system in good shape by maintaining the right balance of the Pitta element that maintains the right balance of the digestive fire. According to Ayurvedic principles, any disorder in the body is a result of a faulty digestive fire that manages its functions. It is very important to restore the imbalance of digestive physiology to heal the anal fistulas. What is Anal Fistula? As discussed above, an anal fistula is an external opening other than the natural anal opening. There is oozing of pus, stool and sometimes the opening closes down for a few days and then the oozing starts again. The area around the anus is tender, painful, and sometimes free from pain. There can be fever if the pus is trapped leading to abscess It is very important to get rid of pus or mucus and heal the fistula. A Fistula is a tube-like structure having openings at 2 ends. In the case of Anal Fistula – 1 opening is inside the anal canal (digestive pipe) and another one is on the skin around the anus. There can be multiple openings outside. The modern medical doctors recommend painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-biotic, and ultimately surgery. Ayurveda recommends natural healing herbs, Oils for local application, wound healing herbs. Mild colon cleansing remedies. Fistula is similarly explained in Ayurveda. It may be accompanied by a discharge from the anus. It has mainly five types which are defined according to the proportion of the three Doshas involved namely, vata, pitta, and kapha. Fistula-in-Ano has been frequently compared with Bhagandara disease explained in Ayurveda. Digestive fire in Ayurveda According to Ayurveda, when our digestion is strong or Agni [fire] / jatharagni is strong we eliminate wastes from our body properly, and to do so our digestive fire should be favorable all the time for a healthy and disease-free life. With natural foods and supplements, it is possible to balance the digestive fire and promote health in human beings. If someone is suffering from anal fistula, he must take good care of the diet. Avoid junk food, unnatural sugars, aerated drinks, milk, and milk products as they may cause abscess formation. Include raw fruits and vegetables and nuts in your diet to regulate bowel movements and speed up wound healing. The herbs should be consumed for a period of at least 3 to 6 months to get good results.
