The Argentine pulled up with an injury during City’s routine 5-0 win over Burnley on Monday night, sparking fears that he would have to spend time on the sidelines. Pep Guardiola confirmed after the match that the attacker’s chances of a swift return did “not look good” and that he had been struggling with a niggle even before the match. Now, however, it has been confirmed that specialist Dr Ramon Cugat will examine Aguero, with the severity of the issue currently unknown. Taking to Twitter following City’s update, the 32-year-old wrote: “The scans I did this morning have confirmed that I have damaged my left knee. It’s a pity but I’m in good spirits and so focused to come back as soon as possible. Thank you very much for all your messages!” The news comes as a blow to the Etihad outfit, who will have wanted their striking talisman fit and firing for the season run-in. While the Premier League title is all but wrapped up, City currently boasts a 2-1 first-leg lead over Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16. An FA Cup quarter-final date against Newcastle also has to be taken in before the season’s end, but it will be Europe’s premier club competition that City will be focusing on, with a European ban appeal still to be decided upon.
