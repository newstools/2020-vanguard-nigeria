This will bring global oil demand to 90.6mb/d; back to levels last seen before the 2014-2016 market downturn. It underscores the fact that we can not rest on our laurels. We need to maintain the laser focus on helping bring supply and demand back into balance and providing a more stable market in the coming months. “This is not the time to stand back and admire what we have achieved thus far; we do not want to jeopardize these successes in any way. We also need to appreciate that the waters remain choppy, and as we navigate our journey, it will not be plain sailing, but we have to remain resolute.
