Liverpool is on the verge of ending a 30 years wait for the Premier League and edged closer with a 4-0 demolition of Crystal Palace at Anfield on Wednesday. Any form of draw between 2nd placed City and 4th placed Chelsea, or a loss for Guardiola’s side will see the Reds crowned Premier League champions Chelsea have scored the title-winning goal between 2014/15 to 2016/17, twice for themselves through Eden Hazard and Michy Batshuayi. The other occasion went in Leicester City’s favour, as Hazard struck the equaliser in a 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur that handed the 2015/16 Trophy to the Foxes.  Chelsea’s current head coach Frank Lampard also has previously had the final say in a title race, netting twice in a 2-0 victory over Bolton Wanderers to clinch the Blues’ first Premier League Trophy in 2004/05. Should Chelsea end Man City’s title hopes with a score-draw or victory it would be the 10th time in the Premier League’s history that the title has been decided when a team outside the top two have taken points off the nearest challengers to the leaders.
