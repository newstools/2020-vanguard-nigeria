Speaking on power, Hamzat said the administration was working on ensuring that people were adequately metered across the state. He said that the government was procuring meter in order to stop the challenges of estimated billings and to enable the power distribution companies to take more electricity from the power generation companies. He said that the challenge with power sector was money, saying that power distribution companies are rejecting power because of money. “We are discussing with the two Discos, the Eko and Ikeja Discos. “People are not ready to pay if you send them estimated bill but by helping with the procurement of metres, it will go a long way to light up Lagos. “We want to work with the Discos on procurement of metres. “The capacity to get 2000 megawatts is there but the challenge is funding,” he said. Hamzat, however, noted that the outbreak of COVID-19 had slowed down the process but he assured that work was ongoing.
