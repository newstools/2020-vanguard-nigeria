These commitments ought to be fully upheld and respected.” “Transparency over transactions by the government is critical to ensuring public confidence in the integrity of management of public resources. The authorities are required to set the highest standards of transparency, accountability and probity in the management of these resources and the programmes that they oversee.” “We would be grateful if the requested information is provided to us within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter.
