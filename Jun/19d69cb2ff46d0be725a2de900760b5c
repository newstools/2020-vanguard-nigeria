Commissioner for Health, Dr Patrick Okundia, who spoke to journalists in Benin City, said physical distancing, compulsory use of face masks, hand hygiene and other epidemiological safety rules must be strictly followed in order to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and protect the people, especially the elderly, who account for most of the fatalities recorded in the state. According to Okundia, “As a government, our highest priority is the health, safety and well-being of all Edo people, and that includes the elderly who are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. “Data have shown that adults of 60 years and above, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions, especially heart disease, lung disease, diabetes or cancer are more likely to have severe, even deadly coronavirus infection than other age groups. This points to the danger ahead if we do not take decisive steps to protect ourselves and our senior citizens who constitute only five per cent of our state’s population”. The commissioner continued, “To complement government’s efforts at containing the pandemic and protecting all residents, we urge you to stay at home and observe all precautionary measures against the spread of the infectious disease, including observing physical distancing, regular handwashing with soap under running water and the use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Cover your mouth and nose properly when sneezing and/or coughing. “On our part, we’re working closely with all community, religious and traditional leaders, relevant agencies and other stakeholders to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to protect our vulnerable population and indeed all Edo citizens.” He further reassured that the state was making steady progress in the management of the pandemic, adding “Edo State has so far recorded 851 confirmed cases, 5,647 suspected cases, 257 discharged persons, 32 deaths and is contact-tracing 2,510 persons” Vanguard As govt reiterates call to protect the elderly With the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) related deaths in Edo State climbing to 31, the government has reiterated the need for residents to comply with all health and safety precautions to check the spread of the virus in order to protect the… June 17, 2020 In "Coronavirus Updates" Govt insists on social distancing, adherence to guidelines, others The Edo State Government has announced two new deaths resulting from coronavirus (COVID-19) complications and the discharge of 16 more patients, who have tested negative to the virus and cleared from the state’s isolation centres.
