The comedian, actor and content creator has been able to carve a niche for himself through combining humour with the everyday experiences of the character he plays. He recently explained how he got what has now become a household name. “It started as far back as 2012 or 2013”, Adebayo told Channels TV’s Sunrise. “I was on the set of Face 2 Face playing the role of an extra. At the time, the character I was playing was nameless. You know these characters they name as ‘Boy 1’ and ‘Boy 2’. The director now wanted for the character to have a name, so when I was about going he asked me to give myself a name and from nowhere I just said Mr Macaroni with the mindset that what we were doing was a comic and Mr Macaroni was supposed to be one happy jolly fellow. So I just said Mr Macaroni and the name stuck.” Adebayo had in other interviews with other news outlets explained how circumstances made him attend a total of four universities before he passed out from the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, scheme in March 2020.
