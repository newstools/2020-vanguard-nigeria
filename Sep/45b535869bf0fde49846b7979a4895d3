Under a regulated market regime, the prices of petroleum products are supposed to be determined by the forces of demand and supply without much intervention. But investigation by Energy Vanguard, showed that the Petroleum Equalisation Fund, PEF, which has the responsibility to settle the cost of bridging petroleum products from one part of Nigeria to another, under a deregulated regime, was still performing its role, despite claims that the sector has been deregulated. Officials of the Fund did not take their calls nor respond, yesterday, but information obtained from its website, stated: “The bridging scheme was originally introduced as a temporary measure during turn-around maintenance, TAM, wherein government sought to encourage and support marketers in transporting petroleum products nationwide. “Although bridging was meant to be a temporary solution until the refineries were producing back at full capacity, the state of the refineries has worsened over the years. “In addition, pipeline vandalism by militants and economic saboteurs has been on the increase, to the point where trucks have become the major source of distributing petroleum products in recent times. “The initial projection was to have a maximum of 10 percent of total petroleum products bridged while the remaining portion will be pumped through the pipelines. “However, trend analysis indicates that bridging of products have consistently increased over the years to about 40 per cent. “There is also a noticeable trend whereby products are bridged from Lagos to the South East and South-South areas of the country to address products unavailability from the refineries in Port Harcourt and Warri.” The investigation further showed that the government would not disband PEF and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, PPPRA, which also, performed pricing function under a regulated regime, until the PIB is passed into law. However, it was established that the legislators, expected to return from their holiday next week would start all over on the PIB, meaning that the passage of the bill would take many months, than previously anticipated. Nevertheless, in his message to Vanguard, the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, GNPC, Professorial Chair, Oil and Gas Economics and Management, Institute for Oil and Gas Studies, University of Cape Coast, Prof. Omowumi Iledare, stated: “Let me say without mincing words that if the President had signed the Petroleum Industry Fiscal Bill and the Host Community Bill, PIGB in 2018, the story would have been a lot different. In fact, the ongoing fire-brigade scrabbling for a way out of deregulation would have been averted.” He added: “Interestingly, 15 months later, the executive Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB to validate deregulation is yet to reach the National Assembly. One of the options is to have a Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN type to regulate the Oil and Gas industry for posterity and the unsigned PIGB is very close to what Nigeria needs to avert Venezuela’s experience.” Vanguard News Nigeria. Petroleum marketers operating in the nation’s downstream sector insist that they are not making enough margins as expected under a deregulated regime. If anything, they argued that in actual terms they are getting even much lower margins despite the increase of petrol price from N65 to N141 per litre. January 17, 2012 In "News" THE recent pronouncement by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, that the downstream petroleum sector had been deregulated since March 19, had further worsened uncertainty in the Nigerian petroleum industry, according to oil marketers and stakeholders in the Nigerian petroleum industry. June 5, 2020 In "Business" PETROLEUM and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, PENGASSAN, has warned that import-driven deregulation will ruin the nation’s petroleum industry, even as it asked government to provide the necessary succor and palliative measures to assuage the impact of import-driven deregulation within a set time-frame.
