Even though it seems to be less deadly and infectious in the country. “Failure to adhere strictly to safety protocols by Nigerians may set us back. What is happening in other countries should give Nigerians the warning of the risks of the second wave of infections,” he said. Adakole said that evidence has shown that the majority of Nigerians are susceptible, adding, in essence, we should not be caught off guard. “The first wave needs to end. And in order to say one wave has ended, the virus would have to be brought under control with zero cases. “In some parts of the world, we’ve seen that happening, while we also have seen record numbers in new infections elsewhere. “In any case, which scenario is more probable depends on decisions by Nigerians and how the Presidential Task Force is prepared in the next three months. “This is crucial in the fight against the second wave of infections in the country,” he said.

The centre on Aug. 31, recorded 138 cases, the country’s lowest daily tally in almost four months. The health agency said that there Nigeria’s total infections hit 55,456 on Tuesday.
