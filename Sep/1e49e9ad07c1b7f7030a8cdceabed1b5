This latest development is coming in at the time when the 57-year-old Spaniard is battling to keep Barcelona captain Lionel Messi this summer. Reports say Messi could leave Barcelona this summer or at the end of his remaining one year contract. Allegations of corruption are said to have been made against Josep Bartomeu according to the report on UK Sun citing Spanish outlet El Mundo.

The investigation is still going on and Josep Bartomeu may be banned from football or a possible jail term if found guilty.
