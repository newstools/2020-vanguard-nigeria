The state commissioner for woman’s affairs and social development, Hafsat Baba, described the approval by the state assembly as a “welcome development” and said that it will serve as a “deterrent” for rapists. State governor Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai will now need to sign the bill for it to become law in the state.
