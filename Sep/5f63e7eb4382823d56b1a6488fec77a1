The training of 1000 youths in GSM phone repairs, hardware, software and entrepreneurship development is a landmark in our commitment to uplifting the wellbeing of a key part of the nation’s population. “It is additionally a reminder of the multiple avenues for empowering youths across Nigeria. We cannot overstate the fact that youths are a crucial category in the nation’s population. They are full of energy and are hopeful for the future.” Lawan who underscored the importance of synergy in governance stressed that the National Assembly will ensure the allocation of resources specifically for the purpose of youth development across the country. The President of the Senate explained that the gesture of parliamentary support in this direction would be backed by further efforts to engage Nigerian youths on ways of additionally stimulating their creativity and productivity levels, so as to keep them away from getting involved in crime. Lawan said, “The future may however not make any meaning to them if their presence is not productive. It is why we will strive to surmount the challenges of limited resources to fend for this population group. This also requires creativity on how to engage them. “With a greater level of engagement for the youths, they can contribute to the economy, still in need of better productivity. Productivity is a prelude to growth, which will also lead to improved wellbeing. “I am happy that earlier remarks have harped on paying attention to the welfare of the youths.

It is the reason the Senate has been consistent in providing legislative impetus for collaborations amongst government agencies, consistent with the mission to deliver on our mandate. We will continue on this path, for the good of Nigerians. “Training 1000 youths in Yobe State is not just a milestone, but part of a concerted effort at improving living conditions.
