A rights and integrity advocacy group, Network for Best Practice and Integrity in Leadership NEBPRIL, made this call in a letter to INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, dated September 3, 2020, by its Chairman Hon. Afam Ogene. It raised concern over the controversy trailing the recent redeployment of a Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Mr Johnson Alalibo, to Edo State, saying Alalibo “has had obvious political exposure, which is evident in his recent participation as an aspirant in governorship election in Bayelsa State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, a major contender in the coming Edo election.” Meanwhile, INEC, has urged religious leaders to sensitise their followers to shun any form of violence in Edo. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Mr John Alalibo, made the call during a one-day stakeholders’ sensitisation meeting in Benin.
