The governor maintained that “Enugu State Government needs a Roadmap that provides clear vision, mission, strategy, prioritized costed plan, milestones and targets to qualify to leverage the available national resources for sanitation” He therefore added that the state government will also lead in strengthening systems at local levels including planning, human and financial resourcing, implementation, private sector mainstreaming as well as monitoring of results, expressing optimism that “this two-day inception workshop is expected to set these agenda”. While thanking UNICEF and U-TOLF for their invaluable support for the workshop, Gov. Ugwuanyi urged other private sector organizations including Rotary Club and religious organizations to help drive the behavioural change needed for attainment of these goals.
