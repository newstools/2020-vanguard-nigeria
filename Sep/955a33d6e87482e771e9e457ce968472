The 4.4-km-long ring road will be open to both self-driving vehicles and ordinary vehicles. Construction on the road started in August 2019 and has since achieved 5G network coverage, installed road conditions monitoring devices, and built a cloud platform control centre. Self-driving cars could realise intelligent driving on this road, and 5G technology has significantly improved the safety of vehicles’ operation, according to the construction unit. Over a dozen Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, have been approved to conduct road tests for self-driving vehicles.
