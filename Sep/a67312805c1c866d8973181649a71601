According to Dai, this is part of the government efforts to alleviate poverty through transportation infrastructure construction. “A total of 96,000 km of tarmac and cement roads were built to connect poor villages with relatively large populations during the 2016 to 2019 period. “Also 16,900 km of expressways were built or improved in poor regions,’’ MOT data showed.
