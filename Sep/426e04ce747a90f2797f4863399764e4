Harris said that he, husband David Burtka and 9-year-old twins Gideon and Harper all “feel great” now. “We were doing our best before, and I thought I had the flu, and I didn’t want to be paranoid about it. And then I lost my sense of taste and smell, which was a big indicator, so we holed up,” Harris said.
