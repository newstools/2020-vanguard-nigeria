He said that the committee discovered that a staff of the ministry allegedly surreptitiously added his brother’s name to the list of people shortlisted for employment into the state civil service in 2009. According to the CP, the committee discovered that one of the brothers had been employed into the civil service without any valid qualifications on Grade level 11. Usman said that the committee discovered that the employee of the state Ministry of Health facilitated the employment of his brother, a commercial motorcycle rider without any valid credentials, into the service in 2009. “Mohammed Ndanusa confessed to the crime saying that he fraudulently employed his brother on Grade level 11 in 2009 and had subsequently facilitated his promotions to his current position of Grade level 14,’’ Usman said.
