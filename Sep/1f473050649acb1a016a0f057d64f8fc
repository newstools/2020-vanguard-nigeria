Comment on the trade reports President, Bank Customer of Nigeria (BCAN) , Dr Uju Ogubunka, said: “If you are not growing, you are declining. When you are declining, it means you are losing grounds. “In this case, it means our economy is contracting and it is not well with our nation. This situation is not in the best interest of the economy. Everybody aspires to grow. Nations are expected to grow and when they grow, it enhances the capacity and capability of the people in that environment. “This can amount to recession because if you have three consecutive negative positions, you are almost at the threshold of recession. Unfortunately the oil price they would have used to redeem us is just not only decreasing even some of our customers who used to patronize us are now drawing backwards.” In his own comment, Uche Uwaleke, a financial Economist and Professor of Capital Market at the Nasarawa State University said : “The immediate effect on the economy is to worsen the country’s Balance of Payment deficit for which the IMF has granted a loan of $3.4 billion to fix. “External merchandise trade will receive boost if we can develop the commodity trading ecosystem in Nigeria. “To this end the government should privatize the Nigeria Commodity Exchange and provide incentives for the development of commodity Exchanges in the country.” NIGERIA’s foreign trade dropped by 18 percent to N8.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, Q1’20, from N10.12 trillion in Q4’19, recording a  trade deficit of N138.98 billion during the period.
