Hubby wants me to wear sexier clothes Dear Bunmi, My husband and I have been married for 15 years and have two lovely children, and I still love him as much. But throughout our marriage, he has always asked me to dress more sexily. He’d love me to wear skimpy, low cut tops to enhance my boobs, and tight fitting trousers. He even buys me eye-popping gears when he travels, and gets very upset when I won’t wear them. But it’s simply not me. I’d look silly dressed like a teenager in heat. Why is he being so shallow even at his age and status as a happily married man? Why can’t he understand that there is a limit a mother of two could be adventurous in her dressing? I mean, if he doesn’t like me in my comfortable jeans and T-shirts, and my sensibly but trendy clothes, then he can’t really like me at all…or what do you think? Gori, by e-mail. Dear Gori, I would go easier on your husband, if I were you. Men and women are made differently. Women typically get more turned on by words— romantic murmurs, dirty talks, erotic tales Men, on the other hand, get turned on by looks — the sight of a gorgeous body does it for them in a way that it just doesn’t for a woman. I don’t think that your man is being shallow at all; he is just being a man! I think he sees you as a very sexual woman…and that is why he wants to see you dress sexually. Next time he buys you sexy outfits, why not indulge him — for no other reason than that you love him? You need not go on the street dressed in them, but what about in the bedroom? VANGUARD As a result, my hostility towards my husband thawed and he started coming to visit. He used to be quite randy and it was a shock to discover that he seldom wants sex. He is in his mid-fifties and I will be 50 soon. Why has his sex life changed… June 24, 2009 In "News" Iâ€™ve been married to my husband for over 20 years and we have four lovely children. Heâ€™s always had series of affairs that Iâ€™ve lost count. Iâ€™ve stopped talking to him about them and when fuends did, he told them smugly that he frIust be doing something right or I… August 25, 2010 In "News" My husband had a stroke a very long time ago and we have not had sex for nine years. We’re both in our early 50s and he doesn’t think I should. Settle for a sexless life; we don’t want to split because we still ‘love each other and our children… October 13, 2010 In "News"
