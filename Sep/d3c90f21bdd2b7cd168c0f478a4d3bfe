A video clip of the MP’s utterances on the fallout between President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto has circulated widely on social media. He is heard telling the president to dissolve the government and quit if he is uncomfortable working with Mr Ruto. Chaotic scenes during the MP’s arrest in his Emurua Dikirr constituency, in the Rift Valley region, were streamed on his Facebook page. The president’s deputy tweeted after Mr Ng’eno’s arrest that “leaders should exercise restraint and avoid insults and bad language against other Kenyans”. “Unsavoury words against mothers and Head of State is a NO, NO. No amount of anger justifies the use of offensive insulting language. There exist decent ways to communicate however one feels,” Mr Ruto tweeted BBC Vanguard Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced he and his deputy William Ruto will be taking a 20-percent pay cut and ministers' salaries will be reduced by 10 percent in a bid to rein in the country's soaring public wage bill.
