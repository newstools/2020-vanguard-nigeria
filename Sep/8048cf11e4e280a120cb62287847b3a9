The People’s Bank of China injected 110 billion yuan (about 16.25 billion U.S. dollars) into the market through seven-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.2 per cent, according to a statement on the website of the central bank. The central bank said that the move was intended to maintain reasonable and ample liquidity in the banking system. As 140 billion yuan of reverse repos and 200 billion yuan of Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) matured Thursday, the operation led to a net withdrawal of 230 billion yuan from the market.
