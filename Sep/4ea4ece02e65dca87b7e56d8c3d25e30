Mr Yekini Nabena, the party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. He added that the party had cleared all aspirants to contest the Sept. 3, primary election after proper screening. The election is to elect APC candidates for the Oct. 31, concurrent legislative by-elections scheduled to be conducted in some constituencies across eight states of the federation. The states include Bayelsa, Borno, Cross River, Imo, Lagos, Plateau, Zamfara and Kogi. “There are no preferred, pre-determined or anointed aspirants,” Nabena said. He added that the clarification became necessary following a statement by an APC chieftain, Mr Okoi Obono-Obla. Obono-Obla had alleged that the party’s leadership was attempting to “foist” a predetermined candidate on the people in the forthcoming Cross River North Senatorial District by-election. Nabena assured that the Gov. Mai Mala Buni-led APC caretaker committee was already moving in a new and progressive direction where things were done properly and internal democracy was the norm. He said the party would continue to give aspirants a level playing field, stressing that only those with impeccable records and were popularly elected were being presented as APC candidates in all elections.
