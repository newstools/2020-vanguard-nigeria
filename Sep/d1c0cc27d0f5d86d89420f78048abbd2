Speaking in Abuja at the First Year Ministerial Performance Review Retreat of his second term, Buhari said he is the only African amongst the least developed countries that the President of the United States invited in the White House. He said he was asked to explain why he is killing Christians in Nigeria. My Response: “I believe I was about the only African amongst the least developed countries that the President of the United States invited and when I was in his office, only myself and himself, only God is a witness, he looked at me in the face and said, ‘Why are you killing Christians?’ “I wondered if it were you, I wondered how you will react. I hope what I was feeling inside did not betray me before him. So, I understood it. “The problem between cattle-rearers and stagnant farmers, I know which is older than me, not to talk of him, because I think I’m a couple of years older than him, were happening. And there was climate change and population growth. “I tried to explain to him that it has got nothing to do with ethnicity or religion. It is a cultural thing which respective leaderships failed the nation.” Vanguard PRESIDENT Donald Trump of the United States of America has tasked President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything within his powers to stop the killings of Christians in Nigeria and also ensure the release of the abducted Dapchi School girl Leah Sharibu April 30, 2018 In "News" Yet as hard as the Obama/Clinton/Kerry triumvirate may try to cover it up, it appears that the message about the real situation in Buhari's Nigeria is beginning to get across to the world.
