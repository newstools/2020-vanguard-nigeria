Malabu and Aliyu Abubakar, a businessman, were re-arraigned alongside six other companies on a 67-count charge before Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja. The companies listed in the charge are: A-Group Construction Company Limited, Rocky Top Resources Limited, Mega Tech Engineering Limited, Novel Properties and Development Company Limited and Carlin International Nigeria Limited. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the suit marked: FHC/CR/268/2016, which initially had nine counts, was filed in 2016. In the nine-count charge, Mohammed Bello Adoke, former Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, including Dan Etete, a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, was mentioned in the suit. However, the names of Adoke and Etete were removed when the defendants were re-arraigned in an amended 48-count charge on July 1, although the EFCC had denied dropping Adoke’s name from the case. At the commencement of proceedings on Tuesday, Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd., Abubakar and the other six companies pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. The EFCC’s Lawyer, Bala Sanga, told the court that Malabu Oil alongside Dauzia Etete (Dan Etete), Seidougha Munamuna and Amaran Joseph, both directors of the company, who are currently on the run, “took control of the sum of $401,540,000 paid from the Federal Government of Nigeria Escrow Account No: 0041451493 IBAN 30CHAS609242411492 with JP Morgan Chase Bank in London into the account 2018288005 of Malabu Oil & Gas Limited domiciled with First Bank of Nigeria Limited.” The Sanga alleged that Malabu oil negotiated and signed the “Block 245 Resolution Agreement with the Federal Government of Nigeria with Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited, and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited, whereby taxes, accruals and royalties due to the Federal Government of Nigeria were unlawfully waived.” Abubakar, on the other hand, was accused of using his companies to receive monies which were proceeds from the Malabu Oil deal. Justice Ekwo adjourned the commencement of trial until Sept. 10.(NAN) Vanguard By Michael Eboh Immediate Past President of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, SPE, Mr. Joe Nwakwue, has called on the Federal Government to immediately find new roles for the Petroleum Equalisation Fund, PEF, and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, PPPRA, stating that the downstream petroleum sector regulators would become… September 8, 2020 In "News" ...Says N1trn saved from subsidy removal ...To merge PPPRA, PEF …Considers cheaper gas products as palliatives By Michael Eboh Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday, disclosed that the Federal Government is not currently in a position, financially, to pay subsidy, as the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted… September 4, 2020 In "News" With the opportunity for public input into the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) foreclosed as the National Assembly winded up its Public Hearing on the matter last July, Nigerians are awaiting with anxiety what would eventually come out of the two chambers as a final Act for the President to endorse… October 6, 2009 In "Sweet Crude"
