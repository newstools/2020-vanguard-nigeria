Former Aviation Minister, Chief Femi Fan-kayode, Thursday threatened to sue a popular blogger, Stella Dimokorkus, over allegation that he ( Fani-kayode) has separated with his wife, Precious Chikwendu. The blogger had alleged that the triplet sons may not have been fathered by Fani-Kayode as they were conceived through IVF and Chikwendu had demanded a DNA test. Reacting in a letter Mr. Adeola Adedipe, Fani-kayode’s lawyer, denied the allegations amd demanded N2bn for denting his image. Part of the letter reads thus: The letter titled, ‘Defamation of Chief Femi Fani-Kayode- Re: Femi Fani-Kayode and Precious Chikwendu Part Ways Over Alleged Domestic Violence’, stated that the allegations were spurious and maliciously engineered. “Our client is aggrieved and has instructed us to draw your attention to these libelous breaches of his person and family. By this publication, our client has received denigrating phone calls and messages across the globe by virtue of which he now sufferers immeasurable loss of goodwill. “However, he is inclined to draw a curtain over the wild and spurious claims if you retract the allegations on the same platform they were published and consequently apologise to him in two other national dailies. “You are also advised to enter into negotiations with us for the sum of two billion naira only being a token amount for penitence. Please bear in mind that you have 14 days from receipt of this letter to comply with the highlighted mitigating measures, the failure of which will leave our client with no preferred alternative than to seek redress in court.”<img class="size-full wp-image-1461818 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fani-kayode-3.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fani-kayode-3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fani-kayode-3.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fani-kayode-3.jpg?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fani-kayode-3.jpg?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fani-kayode-3.jpg?resize=194%2C194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fani-kayode-3.jpg?resize=130%2C130&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Vanguard Precious Chikwendu, wife of erstwhile Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, Tuesday, denied allegation by the Economic and Fianancial Crimes Commission, EFCC, that her Access Bank account was used to launder funds from the NSA's office and that approximately N2.4 million balance was found in her account, when she was arrested… October 18, 2016 In "News" The Former Minister of Aviation and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Femi Fani-Kayode Sunday said he was not losing any sleep over the threat by the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ali Modu Sheriff to sue him over alleged defamation. ‎ February 28, 2016 In "News" DIRECTOR, Media and Publicity of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, PDPPCO, Chief Femi Fani- Kayode has concluded arrangements to sue the National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Alhaji Lai Mohammed over alleged defamatory publication.
