Apostle Bamgbola made the pronouncement in Lagos on Sunday, August, 30, at the occasion of Bishop Isaac Idahosa’s celebration of 31 years in ministry. Fani-Kayode, who has been in the news recently for insulting a journalist, swiftly went on his knees to claim the pronouncement.

He said any law that seeks to regulate the affairs of the church is evil, adding that those that made the law are also evil. Fani-Kayode said: “My position is simple. You cannot regulate the affairs of the church. The church of years has stood for many years; hundreds of thousands of years ever since it was established. “And great powers have come and gone that tried to destroy it; it’s never worked and it can never work. And any law that seeks to regulate the affairs of churches is absolutely evil and I consider that section of that act to be evil. And those that proposed it are evil and it’s unacceptable. And we will not take it, and it will never stand in Jesus’ name, that’s my position.” YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:  Vanguard News He said if he, Apostle Johnson Suleman, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode and the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, had kept quiet like Rev.
