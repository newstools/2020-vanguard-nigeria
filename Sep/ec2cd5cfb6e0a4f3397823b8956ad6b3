We have some regulations in view of the fact that we are still in the COVID-19 period. “The club as a corporate body is seriously working in guiding the health status of golf members. In view of this, we have been able to put in some measures to control the crowd. “There is going to be just one entrance into the club, and a mandatory temperature checks before stepping into the club. No one would be allowed in without a facemask,” he said. He added that there won’t be congestion of golfers at the starter point as social distancing will be maintained. “The players would be playing for two-days so as to reduce the numbers of golfers daily at the club. There’s a playing schedule that everyone would receive before the tournament starts. “This will enable each player to know when they are playing and know they don’t have to be at the club until it’s time for their match,” he said. Meanwhile, the club’s captain, Oladiran Ibironke said that all hands were on deck to make the tournament a memorable one.

It won’t be surprising to see all gold captains from South-West in attendance. Dignitaries will be present here, If Oyo State governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde in around, I know he will honour me on Saturday with the ceremonial tee off alongside with my Patron, Major General Anthony Omozoje, the General Officer Commanding, 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, Odogbo Cantonment, Ibadan,” he said. He added that many measures had been put in place as regards COVID-19 to curtail the spread. “You can’t come into the club for this tournament without a facemask,” he added.
