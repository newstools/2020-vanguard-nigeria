He narrated how left-wing activists, during protests against police brutality and racism over the summer, tore down statues of key historical figures and also lashed out at his opponents who he argued want to paint the US as a racist country founded on oppression. Trump went to the National Archives – the home of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution – to make the speech, on the anniversary of the signing of the constitution in 1787. The president announced he will be establishing a “national commission to promote patriotic education.” There is an ongoing debate about racism and how deeply it is embedded in state structures as well as the legacy of slavery.
