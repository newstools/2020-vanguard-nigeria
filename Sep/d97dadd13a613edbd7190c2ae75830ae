It will be the second African country to be involved in the trials that were suspended on Wednesday after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction in the UK. Already more than 1,000 participants have been enrolled in South Africa for the trials. At least 400 healthcare workers will take part in the Kenyan trials that will be conducted in two coastal towns of Mombasa and Kilifi. The two towns were in April classified as Coronavirus hotspots by the government.

The trials will determine the vaccine’s safety, ability to generate protection, and effectiveness. Preliminary results of the findings will be out in November.
