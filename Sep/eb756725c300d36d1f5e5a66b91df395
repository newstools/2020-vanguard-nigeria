First to meet with the monarch were gladiators of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and All Progressives Congress, APC, who Oba Ewuare II said were hitting up the polity. Noting that elections were not a do-or-die affair, he said the politicians must note that they have only Edo state to call their own and thus must do everything to protect it from disintegration. He said not only has the state been in the news for the wrong reasons but also that the governorship election has pitched the people against themselves. He said “Today is a very historic day, in the history of Edo State and in the history of the ancient kingdom of Benin. I don’t think we had reasons to call this kind of meeting.

You have been together, now you are not together, you confuse the press, you confuse the public, you are confusing everybody. Why are you all doing this? Is it just because of the office? It is for four years and at most another four years, why will you now want lives to be lost? Why do we hear that you are arming thugs? Why?” The monarch extracted commitment to peace from the leaders including Governor Godwin Obaseki, his deputy Comrade Philip Shaibu, the candidate of the APC, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, Oshiomhole and the South-South Vice Chairman of the PDP, Chief Dan Orbih. Former National Chairman of the APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun lauded the initiative of the Oba.
