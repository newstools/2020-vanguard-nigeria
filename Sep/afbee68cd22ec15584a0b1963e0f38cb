Famous Daunemigha, has faulted the claim that former coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), Kingsley Kuku, was indicted by the presidential panel set up at the behest of the National Security Adviser, Babagana Mungono. In a press statement issued recently by Daunemigha, the former governorship aspirant debunked the claim by a recent publication, saying it is misleading. “Our attention has been drawn to a front page report in a newspaper captioned “N712 billion looted by 3 Amnesty Coordinators”. The report  gave the names of the three past Coordinators  of the Amnesty Programme indicted by Presidential panel as Mr Kingsley Kuku , Gen Boroh and Prof Charles Dokubo. “It is instructive to state that the circulating interim report of the panel constituted by the National Security Adviser, General Babagana Mungono (Rtd), is at total variance with the report by The Sun Newspaper and a few online sources. “The circulating panel report did not investigate or review the stewardship of Hon. Kingsley Kuku who served as the last Special Adviser to a Nigerian President on Niger Delta Affairs. The PAP was domiciled in his office by former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, GCON, GCFR. “Without mincing words, Hon. Kuku served meritoriously and delivered without partisan inclination from 2011—2015. “We urge the people of the Niger Delta to be alert and reject the avoidable insults and denigration we face in whatever guise. The PAP under Kuku recorded tremendous strides. It started a downward spiral after Hon. Kuku left office. The last two coordinators, General Paul Boroh and Professor Dokubo, were appointed on the recommendation of the NSA. We urge the National Security Adviser, General Mungono, to do better judgement on leadership and public service in the Niger Delta. He should take full responsibility for the infractions of Boroh and Dokubo, and stop general-brushing as if there are no credible leaders from the Niger Delta who could have improved on the great strides of Kuku and his competent team at the PAP. The APC and indeed all political parties in the Niger Delta have competent, efficient and outstanding youth leaders and elders, men and women, who can effectively manage the PAP. We question the appointive judgement of the NSA, and urge him and Mr President strongly to look beyond military coursemaates and tutors to appoint the right people to manage highly sensitive and strategic intervention agency — the PAP. “I was a founding member of the Izon Youth Movement, former National Deputy President of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), founding member and former governorship candidate of the CPC in Bayelsa State and currently, a chieftain of the APC in Bayelsa State and the Southsouth political zone. I am, however, first an Izon and Niger Delta man. Stop insulting the intelligence and credibility of the Niger Delta people.  Appoint the right people and sustain the peace and security of the region. “Partisan differences apart, we urge our brother and son, Hon. Kingsley Kuku, wherever he is in the United States of America, to focus on his health and disregard this orchestrated media campaign and trial relaunched by reckless and irresponsible media outlets and their sponsors. “The PAP is a product of toil, sweat, blood, death and peace. It was effective under former Presidents Yar’Adua and Jonathan. Comparing Hon. Kuku and his team’s sterling leadership and performance at the PAP to the period you supervised it ( 2015 till now) is like heaven and hell; light and darkness,” the statement read. A former governorship candidate in Bayelsa State on the platform of defunct Congress for Progressive Change, CPC, in 2011, Mr. Famous Daunemgha, has pleaded with the ex-militants in the Niger Delta to forget any plan to resume hostilities. May 3, 2017 In "News" A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has held that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has statutory powers to investigate former President Goodluck Jonathan’s Special Adviser on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, PAP, Dr. Kingsley Kuku, over alleged financial impropriety.
