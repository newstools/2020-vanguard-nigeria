Krug, 38, who is actually white, had already been pulled from teaching duties this semester and faced calls to step down after she admitted being a “culture leech” who publicly lied about her race for years. “Dr. Krug resigned her position, effective immediately,” the university announced on Twitter. “Her classes for this semester will be taught by other faculty members, and students in those courses will receive additional information this week.” Krug, an African history professor at the Washington, DC, school, came clean last week and admitted on a post in Medium that she “eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City under various assumed identities within a Blackness that I had no right to claim.” “I have to build my life on a violent anti-Black lie, and I have lied in every breath I have taken,” she wrote. On Friday, the school announced that Krug would not be teaching this semester, with other faculty at GWU saying they were “appalled” at her long-running deception.
