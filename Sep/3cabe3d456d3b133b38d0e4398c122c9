Godfrey Okoye University, the University of the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, develops its main campus at Ugwuomu Nike to become the number one tourist attraction in Enugu State. The university founded in 2009 by Rev. Fr. Christian Anieke is one of fastest growing faith-based universities in Nigeria. The vice chancellor of Godfrey Okoye University, who is Austrian-trained and an honorary citizen of Mitterkirchen in Austria, has indeed got the Austrian taste for beauty and cleanliness. This explains why everything he does at the university is done with an incredible sense of aesthetics. The main campus of the university is incandescently beautiful. The campus has two beautiful lakes called Godfrey Okoye University Lake (the bigger one) and Uwaebuka Biological Garden Lake (the smaller one). The bigger lake covers about ten hectares and its water is so beautiful that you might be tempted to drink it during the dry season. This lake has been fully developed with a jetty and a motorboat for cruising. The beauty of the surroundings is indeed second to none in Nigeria. The university has left all the trees around the lake untouched to house rare birds and animals for both research and tourism. Sitting at the lake is like being in paradise as you hear the songs of all kinds of birds and watch incredible labyrinths created by ripples of the lake. A boat ride in the bigger lake is so captivating that nobody visits the GO University Lake only once. The sight of trees in bloom, water roses, gentle lake breezes and the music of an incredible choir of birds are such sweet temptations that most humans will not be able to resist. This explains why visitors will always ask whether they could be allowed to come again. Close to the big lake is a smaller one (Uwaebuka Biological Garden Lake) which is home to rare flora and fauna. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1454544" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uwaebuka-Biological-Garden-Lake.png?resize=622%2C358&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="622" height="358" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uwaebuka-Biological-Garden-Lake.png?w=622&amp;ssl=1 622w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uwaebuka-Biological-Garden-Lake.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uwaebuka-Biological-Garden-Lake.png?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uwaebuka-Biological-Garden-Lake.png?resize=260%2C150&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uwaebuka-Biological-Garden-Lake.png?resize=200%2C115&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Our biologists, working with partners from Bowie State University (USA) and Cold Spring Habor Laboratory in New York, have always discovered in the lake new species of fish undocumented in the world DNA data bank. This explains the choice of Godfrey Okoye University as the first DNA Learning Centre in Africa with a full licence from the US Cold Spring Habor Laboratory in New York, USA. Standing like a colossus between the two lakes is the Alhaji Aminu Waziri Tambuwal convocation Arena of Godfrey Okoye University, with its monstrous convocation building (Anthony Mogboh Convocation Building), a four- thousand capacity building looking like an ijere masquerade in the arena that can comfortably take over one hundred thousand persons. The sheer size of the convocation arena reveals a university that is conscious of its growing population as one of the fastest growing private universities in Nigeria as well as its openness for tourism (academic and social tourism). The beautiful symphony of nature at Godfrey Okoye University main campus is rounded off by the unceasing trumpeting of the university cattle at the cattle ranch close to the GO Uni-European Business Park, which is being built to house about thirty companies on campus.
