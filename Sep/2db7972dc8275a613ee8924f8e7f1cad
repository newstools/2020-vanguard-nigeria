The people have been crying out on several occasions to Exxon Mobil to stop the ongoing gas flaring and pay compensation to alleviate their sufferings but to no avail. “The company flares gas at various locations in Akwa Ibom State including gas flaring points at QIT, Ibeno (on-shore), and many other off-shore locations in the Atlantic Ocean.
