The lady, one Elizabeth Onyeniyi had petitioned the Police Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) on her ordeal in the hands of the Kogi Commissioner and other accomplices alleging that she was not only raped, but beaten mercilessly and threatened, prompting the FIB to invite Mr. Danga to appear before the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Gender Unit, for questioning on the 2nd of June 2020, after which the Commissioner was released. It was gathered that discreet investigations by the Gender Unit had been ongoing since June, leading to the discovery of evidence showing the need for the case to be taken to court. Elizabeth Oyeniyi had alleged that Mr. Abdulmumuni Danga, the Commissioner for Water Resources of Kogi state, personally flogged her and said he could have killed her were it not for her young son who was with the mom. She claimed the commissioner then stripped her while some men who worked for Commissioner watched as some others videoed the nude woman as she was being whipped and humiliated. She said the workers collected her phone and destroyed it so that she will not have a record of everything adding that she was made to apologize to the fans of the Commissioner on Facebook denying what she earlier posted, that the Commissioner is a philanthropist and humanitarian. She claimed that the Commissioner gave her #30,000 to get a new phone after making the video which she rejected because she felt humiliated for the beating and being stripped naked in the presence of about 15 men. Ms Onyeniyi claimed that the assault did not end there; that after the attack, the Commissioner drove her to a hotel close to the Kogi State House in Lokoja, the state capital, where he forcefully had sex with her three times overnight. Elizabeth said her ordeal started on March 29, 2020, when she made a post accusing the commissioner for water resources of abandoning his step sister, who is a close friend of hers (Elizabeth Onyeniyi), since he refused to support her financially leading to her friend dropping out of school and that her friend has been speaking to the Commissioner without response. Police sources said that following conclusion of investigations, the Police is charging Mr. Danga along with one Success Omadivi along with some others who are at large. The seven-count charge sheet signed by Assistant Commissioner of Police (Barr at Law), ACP Effiong Asuquo who is the Prosecuting Counsel for the police noted that the case will be prosecuted by the police on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria Both Abdulmumuni Danga and Success Omadivi are to be arraigned at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja Judicial Division.
