The “Cravings” author, 34, shared the news via Instagram, accidentally referring to her unborn child as a “he” in a clip before gasping and covering her mouth. Teigen and husband John Legend, 41, married in 2013 after meeting on the set of his music video for “Stereo” in 2007. They share two children, Luna, 4, and Miles, 2. The star, who was placed on two weeks of bed rest earlier this month, recently admitted that she didn’t take her doctor’s orders seriously enough at first. I didn’t really know that bed rest was in bed. I honestly thought bed rest was you have to really, really relax, stay home,” Teigen shared. “I thought it could be couch rest. But now I’m in trouble. Now I need bed rest.” She added that she is “just trying to be as healthy as possible” as she navigates her third pregnancy, which has proven more difficult than her first two. “It’s a bit of a difficult pregnancy. I feel good though,” she said. “I will say I’m probably being punished for talking so much about how great the first two went. I was like, ‘Oh yeah, pregnancy’s awesome!’ But now I get it. I get anyone that thinks it’s not so awesome but very happy to be carrying this baby.” NY Post Vanguard Donald Trump seems to be having trouble lining up talent for his inauguration, but according to him, he doesn’t want any Hollywood A-listers attending the festivities. Well, Chrissy Teigen fired back, tweeting what we are all thinking.

"Hell, 2019 John is about as equally perplexed but thank you @People for finding me sexy. I'll take it."
