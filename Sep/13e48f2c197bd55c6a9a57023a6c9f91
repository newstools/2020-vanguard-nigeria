The Bank said following its interactions with women across the country, it has discovered that most of them are unable to access finance to either stabilize or scale their businesses mainly because of a lack of  awareness on how to leverage bank funding to drive and sustain profit. It notes that this finding is contrary to the popularly, but erroneously held view that unavailability of finance is the main challenge facing the average business woman. Speaking further on the benefits of the Polaris Pearl Account, the Bank’s Group Head, Products and Market Development, Mrs. Adebimpe Ihekuna, explained that lack of proper guidance on access to opportunities is also a major hindrance  to women in their entrepreneurial ventures. She stated: “We have carefully designed Polaris Pearl Account for women or groups of women entrepreneurs who initiate, organize, and operate a business enterprise to fulfill an existing need for the purpose of  making profit.” “With Polaris Pearl, Women Entrepreneurs do not only have access to collateral-free loans but are also regularly supported in understanding vital aspects of business development such as business training,  business tips and positioning for new opportunities. We also support them with requisite skills on emerging local and global trends that may impact their businesses”. Speaking on the value proposition of the Polaris Pearl, the Bank’s Acting Managing Director/CEO Mr. Innocent Ike, explained that “Polaris Bank is a member of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI)  and hence a critical stakeholder in the global conversation about gender inclusion and women empowerment especially in enhancing their access to finance and business opportunities.” He said the empowerment of Nigerian women constitutes one of the six pillars of Polaris Bank’s corporate citizenship and Sustainability focus. SKYE Bank Plc said it will organise webinar 2.0 for Skye Pearl subscribers following the success of its webinar 1.0 with the theme “Tips to survive a challenging economy” which attracted almost 10,000 viewers. May 1, 2017 In "Business" Access Bank Plc said it has provided skills support to 2,200 women in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria, through the Womenpreneur business workshop, a flagship training of the bank's W Academy initiative.
