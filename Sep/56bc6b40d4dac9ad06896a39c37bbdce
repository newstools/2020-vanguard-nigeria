President of NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba in his reaction to the new increase of Petroleum pump price accused the Federal Government of taking Nigerians for granted. Wabba said with the development, the organised labour cannot guarantee industrial harmony. According to him, “In fact Nigerians and even NLC we are in a shock, and this increase is coming at a time when many Nigerians are passing through very peculiar and precarious times.” “It’s like Nigerian are being taken for a ride, the increase in price of petroleum is like adding sult to injury. “The increase in price of petroleum has happened now more than three times in three months, only yesterday they hiked the tariff of electricity. And to compound it they also reduced the interest rate of savings which effects mostly the poor and the vulnerable. “While rejecting this with the strongest terms, I think Nigerian government is taking Nigerians for granted.” “At the end of the day, Nigerians are becoming poorer and poorer, in fact many people are already on the edge. Many workers are already on the edge. “Certainly we cannot guarantee industrial peace and harmony, and we will have to call our organs and we will have to also react but we reject it in its entirety. “They have betrayed the trust of Nigerians, for Nigerians to be protected against the economic challenge that is affecting us.” Vanguard Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, on Thursday, rejected the new pump price of fuel announced by the Petroleum Products Price Regulatory Agency, PPPRA, and demanded immediate reversal, contending that the new price, amid COVID-19 pandemic, will kill businesses and worsen poverty level across the country.
