Guardiola said this was because Aguero was yet to train with the club since suffering a knee injury in June. The Argentine was sidelined for the last 12 matches of Manchester City’s 2019/2020 campaign, including their two UEFA Champions League fixtures in August. Guardiola said the 32-year-old may not be fit until November. “We knew the injury was difficult,” Guardiola said. “He still hasn’t had one training session with us and Sergio is not a guy who regains his physical condition quickly. “He has been out for a long time.
