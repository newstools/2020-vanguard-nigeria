The victim, a married woman with children, who owns a farm in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT Abuja, reportedly had the intention of setting up other businesses back home. She was said to have been introduced to Ehiarinmian, as capable of providing her with security to and from the farm. However, the suspect was said to have made a love advance to her, with a promise to marry her, even though she claimed he was aware she was married. Trouble started after she sensed that her money and property were being siphoned, consequent upon which she alerted the Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of zone 2, AIG Ahmed Illyasu.
