PSG went down 1-0 to rivals Marseille on Sunday, but the match was marred by an incredible finale in which five players were dismissed. Neymar, the world’s most expensive player, was the last of those to see red after striking Alvaro Gonzalez on the back of the head. The Brazilian alleged afterwards he had been the victim of racist abuse from Alvaro, who denied the accusations. The results of a disciplinary tribunal were revealed on Wednesday and Neymar has had a third match added to his ban as a suspended sentence. Layvin Kurzawa was handed a six-game ban, with Leandro Paredes also out for just two fixtures.
