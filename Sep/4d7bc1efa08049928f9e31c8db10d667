We shall ensure that the processes leading to the party primary are fair, transparent and credible. “We will make available to all the aspirants, list of all the party officials from the ward to the state level to enable them to reach out to the would-be delegates so that they can sell their programmes and manifestoes. “That list makes up more than two –thirds of statutory delegates  By so doing, all the aspirants will be satisfied that the exercise is transparent.” “We also want you to see other contestants as brothers and sisters and we advise that you focus on your programmes for the state in soliciting for votes from the delegates because at the end of the day, it is the party that will win. “The PDP must get back to the winning ways in Anambra State to continue with the developmental strides the party is known for”. He cautioned the governorship aspirants to avoid taking actions or making statements that were capable of maligning their opponents, assuring that the PDP under his watch would prefer to see aspirants discuss the socioeconomic and political issues affecting the state and suggest possible solutions. Declaring his intention to vie for the governorship of the state, Maduafokwa said that if given the opportunity to lead the state, he would execute developmental projects that would add value to the state’s economy and ensure accountability. “We will ensure accountability to Ndi Anambra. We will revamp the health sector by equipping the existing ones.
