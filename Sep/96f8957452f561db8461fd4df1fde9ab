Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola who made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government (FG), congratulated all Nigerians on the celebration of the country’s Diamond Jubilee and assured them of the Government’s unwavering commitment to the socio-economic transformation of the country. His declaration was contained in a statement issued Tuesday in Abuja and signed by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Barr. Georgina Ekeoma Ehuriah. Accoy to the minister, “our warmth, welcoming spirit and love as well as the abundant wealth inherent in our human capital and the richness of our land, makes Nigeria unarguably the leading black nation in the world and Africa’s pride and beacon of hope if we can rally ourselves together to harness our potentials. “A country of about 200 million people whose natural talent, grit, and passion glitter like the precious DIAMOND that we are. Nigerians are sparkling like diamonds in the pack, whether in Academia, Business, Innovation, Music, Movie, Entertainment, Fashion, and culture. We are indeed the leading black nation in the entire world and no doubt Africa’s pride and beacon of hope”. He said though, “celebrating sixty years of independence really calls for pomp and pageantry, but with the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced all nations in the world to think and act cautiously, we cannot avoid the imperative of a low-keyed celebration at this time. “While wishing Nigerians a fruitful independence celebration, he reminded them of the fact that our founding fathers, in spite of the differences in faith, tribe and tongue came together for Nigeria’s independence. “He, therefore, called on all Nigerians to join hands together with the present Administration in its quest to ensure a better Nigeria for all citizens, both at home and abroad as this, he said, shall be a befitting tribute to the struggles of our heroes past. We must together make Nigeria great”, he added.
