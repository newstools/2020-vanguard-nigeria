Godfrey Okoye University, the University of the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, believes that education cannot be the exclusive preserve of the elite or the wealthy. This explains why the university goes the extra mile to keep its fees as low as possible and also offers lots of scholarships. Godfrey Okoye University has given over three hundred scholarships to students since its inception. Besides, GO University scholarships come in different shapes and sizes. There is a Directorate for Scholarship Trust Fund and Projects headed by Mr. Fredrick Ozoilo. The Board of Trustees of the Directorate, which has Igwe Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, as Chairman, discusses and approves the yearly budget and approves all scholarships. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1462217" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?resize=640%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="478" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?resize=1024%2C764&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?resize=768%2C573&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?resize=58%2C43&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?resize=260%2C194&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?resize=174%2C130&amp;ssl=1 174w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-2.png?w=1174&amp;ssl=1 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> At the moment about one hundred students are studying on GO University scholarship. Most scholarships are strictly based on merit. In other words, only those who pass the scholarship examinations get our merit-based scholarships. But there are also financial interventions that are given to those who have gained admissions but who run into various problems because of the loss of their parents or extreme situations in the family. Such students are not required to write any scholarship examinations but are given scholarships as financial interventions to help them round off their studies. Such interventions have really helped many of our poor students to finish their studies without tears. For instance, Godfrey Okoye University intervened when the Boko Haram insurgency destroyed the businesses and means of livelihood of the parents of some students from the North. GO University gave scholarships to many of the students from the North to help them finish their studies. Godfrey Okoye University gives scholarship every year to the student with the highest CGPA. The winner of the scholarship, who is also crowned Vice-Chancellor-for-One-Day, can also transfer the scholarship to another person studying in the university if he or she so desires. There are also lots of faculty-based scholarships in our different faculties, especially our enviable and famous Law Faculty. Also friends of Godfrey Okoye University give individual scholarships. Mr. Walter Linsi from Switzerland has given scholarship to fifty students, which is still running. Also Mr. Andreas Gebauer, the Project Director of GO Uni-European Business Park, and Igwe Achebe, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Scholarship Trust Fund Directorate, have continued to fund our scholarship scheme magnanimously. <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1462219" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?resize=372%2C481&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="372" height="481" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?resize=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 792w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?resize=768%2C993&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?resize=45%2C58&amp;ssl=1 45w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?resize=150%2C194&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?resize=101%2C130&amp;ssl=1 101w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Godfrey-Okoye-University-3.png?w=866&amp;ssl=1 866w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The scholarship exams of Godfrey Okoye University will be taken by our newly admitted students on a date to be announced in October.
