Shorts will feature a multi-segment camera to edit multiple video clips together, and will feature a library of songs to include with the videos. Like TikTok, Shorts will also have speed controls that “give you the flexibility to be creative in your performance,” as well as a timer and countdown to “easily record, hands-free,” Jaffe said. The new product will first be released over the next few days in India where it will be tested with “a handful of creation tools,” Chris Jaffe, YouTube vice president of product management wrote in a blog post on the company’s website.
