This comes as Nigerians social distance, stay at home and remain safe in the face the Covid-19 pandemic. In a recent announcement by the organisations, the first phase of the collaboration would enable Paga customers to easily initiate and complete payment to all Remita billers and merchants right from Paga’s web channel – paga.com. Paga’s agents nationwide would also be able to process end-to-end payments to all Remita customers from their platforms. The initiative is applauded by industry enthusiasts and is expected to chart the path for deeper collaboration within the fintech ecosystem, making electronic payments more attractive and less stressful for customers irrespective of their needs and location. According to Ezinne Obikile, SystemSpecs Executive Director, Infrastructure and Payments Gateway; “SystemSpecs is committed to driving financial inclusion and providing payment convenience to all, which underscores this strategic partnership with Paga to extend a wide range of financial solutions and services to customers everywhere, even at a time as this.” Also commenting, Jay Alabraba, Co-founder and Director of Business Development, Paga said: “In our commitment to make payments easier for all Nigerians and businesses, we are pleased to collaborate with SystemSpecs. Our goal is to always provide an improved experience to our customers everywhere, by leveraging digital technology. This collaboration would further help us meet the needs of individuals who seek to make various bill payments, including those in emerging markets.” The immediate impact of the collaboration on the public is the easy generation of Remita Retrieval Reference (RRR) and payments into the Federal Government’s Treasury Single Account. It would also enable payments to other Remita billers such as state governments, tertiary institutions and other organisations by Paga customers and agents directly through Paga platforms. Founded in 2009 with a purpose to make it simple for one billion people to access and use money, Paga is the largest digital wallet operator in Nigeria with a nationwide network which consists of over 23,000 agents, including mom and pop stores as well as pharmaceutical and grocery stores where people can walk in for quick and easy access to financial services.
