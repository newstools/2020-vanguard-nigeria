The Merchlist.co platform which was rapidly developed as a solution to keep SMEs viable during the COVID-19 pandemic has two main features: 1) BUY – which allows customers purchase directly from SMEs, and 2) DISCOVER – which aggregates services, contact details and delivery methods, ensuring that end users can see service availability in real-time. Partner SMEs on Merchlist.co include Grocery Bazaar, Grand Square, Rx Pharmacy, Food Jaar, and The Meat Shop. While the platform is currently in its testing stage, only accepting a limited number of orders per day, plans are said to be underway to roll out in additional markets across Nigeria, allowing more SMEs and merchants to go digital and access end-users. Speaking on the innovation, Chief Operating Officer of Rensource, Anu Adasolum said the company’s mission is focussed on enabling access to critical services, initially to energy, and now broadening that range. He explained that this new addition to its product portfolio is consistent with the company’s mission, providing access to essential items including groceries, toiletries, beauty and cleaning products, all at the touch of a button. He said “At Rensource we’re focused on connecting people to the most important things.
