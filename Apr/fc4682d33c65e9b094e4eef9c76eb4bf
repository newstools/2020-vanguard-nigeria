Tests on 63 people were conducted after a 19-year-old female migrant who gave birth in a hospital in Athens was found infected, becoming the first recorded case among thousands of asylum seekers living in overcrowded camps across Greece. None of the confirmed cases showed any symptoms, the ministry said, adding that it was continuing its tests. Greece, which recorded its first coronavirus case at the end of February, has reported 1,415 cases so far, and 50 deaths. It is the gateway to Europe for people fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and beyond, with more than a million passing through Greece during the migrant crisis of 2015-2016. Any movement in and out of the Ritsona camp, which is 75 kilometres (45 miles) northeast of Athens and hosts hundreds of people, will be restricted for 14 days, the ministry said. Police would monitor the implementation of the measures. The camp in central Greece has an isolation area for coronavirus patients should the need arise, sources have said. More than 40,000 asylum-seekers are stuck in overcrowded refugee camps on Greece’s outlying islands, in conditions that aid organisations say are appalling and which the government itself has described as a “ticking health bomb”. “This news confirms what we have been repeatedly calling for; it is urgently needed to evacuate migrants out of the Greek islands to EU countries,” said Leila Bodeux, policy and advocacy officer for Caritas Europa, an aid agency. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday evening that Greece was ready to protect its islands, where no case has been recorded so far, but that the EU should do more to improve conditions in camps and to relocate people to other countries. vanguard Following the death of a female asylum seeker in Greece's asylum camp, hundreds of asylum seekers protested the conditions of the camp.
