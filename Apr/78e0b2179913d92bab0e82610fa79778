Trump said China “misled us,” as he referred to investigations the White House asked the US intelligence agencies to conduct into whether China and the WHO covered up what they knew about the early spread of COVID-19. “They must have known more than they knew,” he told reporters about the UN agency during a meeting with Louisiana Gov.

Despite the difference in payments, “they seem to work for China, and they should have been in there early on. They should have known what was going on. And they should have been able to stop it,” Trump said. Earlier this month, Trump froze payments to the WHO until a review could be completed over whether it mismanaged or worked with China to cover up the spread of the virus.
