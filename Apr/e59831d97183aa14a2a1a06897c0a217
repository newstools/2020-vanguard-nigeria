He said that though the ministry did not have the details of what led to the disengagement of their appointment but “our duty is to act as conciliator, stressing that since the courts were not sitting, the ministry will not sit akimbo. ” The disengaged health workers can get across to the ministry through the email of my personal address on social media for the ministry to act as conciliator,” he said. He stated that the ministry knew the importance of health workers at this time of COVID-19 pandemic and so, privilege of mediating in the logjam would be provided to the health workers to resolve the disagreement.
