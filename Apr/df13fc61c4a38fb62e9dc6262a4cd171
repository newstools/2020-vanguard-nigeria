During the national mourning event, national flags across China and at Chinese embassies and consulates abroad were lowered to half-mast, and public entertainment activities halted. The three minutes of silence started on time at 10 am (0200 GMT). At the same time, car horns honked, trains and ships sounded their whistles, and air defence alarms went off. The event is intended to honour “martyrs and dead compatriots killed in the fight against the new coronavirus epidemic,” the State Council said on Friday.
