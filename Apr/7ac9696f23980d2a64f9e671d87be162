The videos, one taken in 2004 and two in 2015, were released after federal officials determined the footage “does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems,” and “does not impinge on any subsequent investigations,” the department said in a statement Monday.  “DOD is releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos,” the statement said. “The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as ‘unidentified.’” The videos were initially published in 2017 and 2018 by the To The Stars Academy, a UFO research group founded by former Blink-182 singer Tom DeLonge, and in the New York Times, Vice reported Monday. One of the clips, identified as FLIR.mp4, shows a dark circular object flying far in front of a jet. A second, identified as GOFAST.wmv, shows a small object racing over land at astonishing speed. The third, GIMBAL.wmv, shows a circular object first speeding, then seeming to slow and come closer to the pilot’s camera. All of the videos are well-known to UFO buffs. The videos provide “tantalizing evidence” that US airmen have spotted and filmed the UFOs, Vice said. The Pentagon has in the past been inconsistent in its acknowledgement of the existence of the videos, the outlet said.
