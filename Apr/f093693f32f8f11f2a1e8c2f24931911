The finals had been scheduled for June 4 and June 7 in Houston and Dallas. “As we continue to assess our competitions scheduled to be played in the coming months, the welfare of everyone involved in football across our region remains our first priority,” CONCACAF said in a statement. “Given the ongoing public health situation, and following consultation with FIFA regarding the international football calendar, we have made the decision to suspend the CONCACAF Nations League Finals.” Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico and the United States had been due to take part in the finals.
