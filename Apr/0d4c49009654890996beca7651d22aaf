In a statement in Awka, Obaze, who is also a former Secretary to the Anambra State Government, SSG, expressed the fear that Kano might soon become the epicenter of the pandemic if not urgently handled. He said: “NCDC and FGN need to shift focus urgently to Kano, which possibly may become Nigeria’s next Covid-19 ground zero and investigate the spate of unexplained deaths. “I had earlier warned that not responding robustly now, will in the longer term, cost Nigeria more financially, materially, morally and certainly, in terms of human casualties.” According to him, “when COVID-19 hits Nigeria fully, the challenge and national mobilization needed to respond adequately will require the replication of another civil war situation capacity,” warning that, “We are gradually gravitating to that moment of shock.” Vanguard Nigeria News A governance and policy expert, Mr Oseloka Obaze says all the 36 states and Abuja should be given equal capacity to manage cases of the coronavirus and also contain the spread.
