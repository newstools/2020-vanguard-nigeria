These two new inactivated coronavirus vaccines were developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and a unit of Nasdaq-listed Sinovac Biotech in Beijing in conjunction with relevant scientific research institutions. Earlier, one of the Chinese medical experts, Wang Kaili, warned that the coronavirus infection vaccine currently being developed by China is just entering the first phase of the clinical trials. The expert added that it will probably take more than a year to finish it. Clinical trials of the first vaccine developed in China began in mid-March, with 108 volunteers taking part in them.
