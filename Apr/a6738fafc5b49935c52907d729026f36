The son of former Vice President Abubakar Atiku has spoken from his COVID-19 isolation centre optimistic that he will soon be out. Mohammed Atiku explained that he was asymptomatic in his first few days at the isolation centre and nervous; “I had a level of anxiety and a little bit of trauma, especially being the index case here in Abuja. That was really the main challenge.” The younger Atiku said: “On the 20th of (March), I tested positive for COVID-19 and I was brought over to the Isolation Centre at Gwagwalada University Teaching Hospital where I have been since. “I am currently on my 12th day here and I hope to be out soon – perhaps when my next test is taken and the results are favourable. I should be on my way out, hopefully. “I decided to do this video so that I could speak about my experience to be of help to Nigerians. “I was asymptomatic in my first few days here and nervous; I had a level of anxiety and a little bit of trauma, especially being the index case here in Abuja. That was really the main challenge. “But day by day, I grew stronger, thanks largely to all the goodwill and prayers and support I got from a vast array of Nigerians many of whom I don’t know. My family and friends too and a whole lot of people. “I thank God I am well and good,” Atiku said.
