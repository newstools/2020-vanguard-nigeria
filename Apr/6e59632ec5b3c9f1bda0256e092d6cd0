While presenting the materials, Mandela said the gesture had become imperative given the socioeconomic effects of the lockdown on the people occasioned by the need to prevent and contain the rampaging coronavirus which has put the entire world on edge. “This coronavirus pandemic has adversely affected the socio-economic activities of our people, as government as a matter of necessity moves to prevent and contain its unlikely outbreak in Abia State through extreme but inevitable measures in order to keep all of us safe. The responsibility to help cushion the effects of these measures on our people, therefore, falls on us as leaders, and that is why I am here today to present these items to our people through our highly revered traditional rulers,” he said. On his choice of presenting the materials through the several traditional rulers of Abiriba and Nkporo, the two towns that make up his constituency, and not directly to the people, the lawmaker said it was to ensure that the directives for social distancing as given by the Governor Okezie Ikpeazu-led administration in its determination to prevent and contain the virus in the state is not breached. He further admonished the people to obey all government directives and follow established protocols in the fight against the pandemic. Items presented included bags of 50kg rice, hundreds of 60ml bottles of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and a cash sum of N500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand Naira) to be shared between the two communities. Mandela who charged the traditional rulers to ensure that the relief materials got to indigent persons in the communities, personally shared another sum of N200,000 to needy women in the communities. Responding, a visibly elated Enachioken of Abiriba, HRM Eze Kalu Kalu Ogbu, who also doubles as the Deputy Chairman of Abia State Council of Traditional Rulers, thanked the lawmaker for his gesture saying he was not surprised at it, knowing that “Honorable Egwuronu Obasi has always been in touch with his constituents, and as a well-known philanthropist, he has always come to the aid of his people”. The other traditional rulers including HRH Eze Eme Uguru Ikpoka, the Ukpaghari of Amogudu, HRM Eze U. I. Eme, the Egwugwo of Amodu Autonomous Community, Nkporo, and HRH Eze U.O. Agbaeze, the Otam of Amurie Autonomous Community, thanked Mandela Obasi for the kind gesture, promising that they would ensure a fair and equitable distribution of the items to those they are actually meant for. The other traditional rulers also present at the gathering were HRH Eze Benjamin Agwu, the Efa of Agboji Community, Abiriba, Eze Innocent Otisi, Ikuku Ejire of Ogwofia Autonomous Community, Eze Patrick Ogbuagu, Ezeaja of Nkporo, Eze Innocent Mbah, Okwo of Etitiama Nkporo, Eze Ojukwu Imo Kalu, the Achi of Achi Aliobi, Agbaja Nkporo and other cabinet members of Enachioken-in-Council.
