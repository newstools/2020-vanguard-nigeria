Disclosing this to journalists shortly after a tour of the hospital’s isolation centre, the CMAC who said despite the fact that the patient hid his medical and travel history, none of the staff of the hospital was exposed unnecessarily. “There is what we call universal precaution, no doctor or nurses will see patients without observing a high index of suspicion, especially, this period that we have COVID-19, it is assumed that every patient is a COVID-19 patient until proven otherwise so none of our doctors was unnecessarily exposed. They applied a high index of suspicion, they used gloves and do exactly what they needed to do. But however, once the patient tested positive everybody will become worried.  You need not get worried if you are not unnecessarily exposed and they were not. “Despite that, we have identified about 12 of our staff, doctors, nurses, nursing assistant, security men and all of them are under surveillance and this is the fourth day they are doing well. “There some who were very close to the patient, they are doctors and nurses it is only about three of them that are under isolation but as a precaution we needed to do that. We don’t expect any of them to test positive because they did what they were expected to do in such cases. “Now, in our accident and emergency, nurses and doctors were mask and gloves and if there is any reasons to suspect COVID-19, they will call in the infectious disease experts in the hospital and they will take it up from there.” vanguard As LUTH assembles 120 staff to combat COVID-19 Says 12 staff under surveillance, 3 on isolation over death of patient By Chioma Obinna The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 yesterday inspected the Lagos University Teaching Hospital’s (LUTH) isolation centre in readiness to the admission of positive persons at the facility… April 7, 2020 In "Coronavirus Updates" By Chioma Obinna Contrary to speculations in some quarters that the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH, has been shut down following the death of a COVID-19 patient, the management of the hospital Saturday debunked the rumour, saying "the hospital is open and working”.
