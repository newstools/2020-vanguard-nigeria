I have to say, I love you so much, Robyn. She did so much for me. I appreciate everything she has done.” According to her father, the Fenty Beauty founder sent a ventilator to his Caribbean home and gave him “more than enough” to battle the illness that left him feeling weak and frightened for his life “I got a fever up inside of my nose. I had a fever across my lips. It was just a lot of fever,” Fenty revealed. “I feared the worst. I thought I was going to die, honestly.” Two weeks after being quarantined at the Paragon Isolation Center, Fenty was declared virus-free. He is now resting in his St. James home. “I want everybody to stay home. This is a serious situation,” Fenty asked of the public. “More serious than people realize. Please stay home.” Rihanna is also using her time and money to help those globally affected by the virus, donating $5 million to the cause via her Clara Lionel Foundation.
