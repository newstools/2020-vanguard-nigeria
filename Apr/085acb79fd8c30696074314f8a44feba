It said a recent study revealed that the “number of acutely food insecure Zimbabweans had risen to 4.3 million, from 3.8 million at the end of last year”. In all 7.7 million people, more than half the population were food insecure and needed multi-sectoral humanitarian support according to the UN. In previous hunger years, mainly the rural population would require food aid, but lately millions of urban dwellers are needing food aid. “With most Zimbabweans already struggling to put food on the table, the COVID pandemic risks even wider and deeper desperation,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP’s Zimbabwe country director. “We must all do our utmost to prevent this tragedy turning into a catastrophe,” he said in a statement.
