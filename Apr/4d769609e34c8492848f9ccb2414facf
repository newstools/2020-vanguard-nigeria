The 28-year-old fighter appealed to people to just stay home as he announced that his grandmother had died yesterday. ‘It’s serious!’ Yarde wrote on social media. ‘People are still going out when they don’t need to. I know there’s a lot of opinions about Covid-19 and I have mine but I just know opinions ain’t worth risking your life and others. Just stay home.’ Yarde’s father, who the boxer said had been ‘fit with no health issues’, died last week. ‘We can’t begin to imagine what Anthony and his family are going through and our sincere condolences go out to them. ‘Please listen to his heartfelt personal plea, stay at home to save lives.’ Yarde’s next fight was set to be against Britain’s Lyndon Arthur on April 11, but the event has been delayed until 11 July because of the pandemic. Today’s 684 death toll is another record one-day high. Yesterday there was a record of 569 new fatalities announced by the Department of Health. The new numbers mean the number of people dead from COVID-19 in the UK has risen five-fold in a week, from just 759 last Friday, March 27. The numbers behind the UK’s crisis have escalated rapidly over the past seven days and Health Secretary Matt Hancock today said the virus ‘continues its grim march’. He admitted that next week is likely to be worse still, potentially topping out at more than 1,000 deaths per day by Easter Sunday. Britain is still being hammered by the consequences of huge numbers of people catching the coronavirus before the country went into total lockdown last week. The increases being seen each day are ‘expected’, scientists say. Experts say it could take another couple of weeks before the benefits of social distancing start to show in NHS statistics – but they insist that the outbreak will taper off and the daily numbers will start to fall, as reported by Dailymail vanguard Hughie Fury hopes to defy the odds after 17 months of inactivity and win a world heavyweight title from Joseph Parker for the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing.
