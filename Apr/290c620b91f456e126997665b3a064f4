The 26-year-old Matthew David Hughes smashed a kitchen window with a paving stone and climbed into in the rapper’s home in a gated community in the Detroit-area around 4 a.m. earlier this month, TMZ reports. The smashed window triggered Slim Shady’s alarm system, waking up the rapper who found the intruder in his living room, the report says. But the intruder didn’t try to steal anything. Apparently, Hughes just wanted some face time with the rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, TMZ reports. The alarm also woke up the security guards, who rushed into the house and detained Hughes until cops showed up, according to TMZ. A representative for Slim Shady told XXL, though, that Eminem was the one who detained Hughes till cops showed up. Hughes faces a pair of felonies, home invasion and malicious destruction of a building was held on $50,000 bond on April 6.
