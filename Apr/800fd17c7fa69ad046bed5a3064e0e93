One of the boys received a custodial sentence of two years and six months. The two others were each handed suspended sentences of 18 months, but they are to be detained for an initial four weeks. All three boys were 14 at the time of the crime which shocked Germany in 2019. None of those involved have been identified, and proceedings were held entirely behind closed doors. The court found that one of the accused, along with a boy then aged 12, had convinced their victim, then aged 18, to join them in woodland. All three were aware that there would be sexual activity. When the other two defendants, along with another 12-year-old, joined them, the woman made clear she no longer wished to participate. “The gang then forced sex on her, striking her in the process,’’ the court found. The two 12-year-old boys did not face legal proceedings, as they cannot be held responsible under German law, a fact which at the time of the crime provoked intense debate across Germany. Muelheim municipality has also sought to have the family of the main accused deported to Bulgaria, without success. All five boys involved, the three accused and the two 12-year-old boys, hold Bulgarian nationality. dpa/NAN Vanguard Nigeria News Days after an alleged gang-rape victim was set on fire, a note was left at the family home of an 18-year-old set to testify in her own case against a man she had accused of rape. “Consequences may be worse than what happened in Unnao,” the note read, alluding to… December 16, 2019 In "Foreign" A Spanish court sentenced Tuesday a man to 18 months in jail for setting up a website showing where a notorious gang rape took place during the running of the bulls festival in the city of Pamplona three years ago.
