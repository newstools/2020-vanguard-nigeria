President Trump on Wednesday said he’ll examine a request for a pardon from Joe “Exotic” Maldonado-Passage, the star of the hugely popular Netflix series “Tiger King.” “I’ll take a look,” Trump told a Post reporter when asked about the case and his son’s support for a pardon during a White House briefing.

The seven-part docu-series on Maldonado-Passage, “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” has been a hit with Netflix viewers — drawing 34.3 million unique viewers in the first 10 days since its March 20 release.
