Deaths: 51 pic.twitter.com/1ul1P8JvTH — NCDC (@NCDCgov) April 29, 2020  Lagos, being the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria, has 931 confirmed cases. The United States of America (USA) still tops the unpopular COVID-19 global chart by some miles with over 1,064,572 recorded cases. 61,669 deaths and 147, 411 recovered cases. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) along with some medical experts have projected that Nigeria is not anywhere near flattening the COVID-19 curve. The NCDC projected on 17th, April 2020 that the virus will cut across the 36 states of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It took just two weeks for that prediction to come to pass as all states in Nigeria have now recorded at least a case. Vanguard spoke with some experts who submitted that the battle against COVID-19 had rarely started. Dr Casmier Ifeanyi, Publicity Secretary, Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria, AMLSN said: ” “The curve is not flattening because we get all our results in retrospect. Our laboratory test results for COVID-19 testing are turned-in in arrears. The value known today is actually what it was in a minimum of five days before the announcement. “We find out that the numbers positive for COVID-19 cases have continued to increase by the day, so no one can claim scientifically that we are flattening the curve.  If we continue to get positive cases particularly in the states where we had not gotten report before like in Kano State that has just jumped from 3 cases to about 21 cases in a matter of 72 hours interval. Certainly, we are not flattening the curve.” Versatile virologist, Prof Oyewale Tomori also stated that Remember the lockdown was to flatten the ‘pot belly’ of COVID-!9. Unfortunately, the potbelly is getting bigger and we are not succeeding in flattening it. “At the beginning of the lockdown, we had 131 cases, two weeks later, at the end of the lockdown, the number of cases went up to 343, a little more than a two-and-a-half fold increase. Remember, the recoveries and the deaths will come from the cases.” The Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Academy of Science, NAS, Dr Doyin Odubanjo also explained that “We must know that people will be dying even from other things because they cannot get drugs or access to health care. So, the lockdown was good to quickly control a chaotic situation but you have to know that it must not continue like that.“ Vanguard By David Royal The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says 196 new cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,728.
