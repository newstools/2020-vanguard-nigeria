The mattresses were presented to the Deputy Governor of Ogun State, Engineer Noimot Salako Oyedele by Mouka’s Chief Commercial Officer, Dimeji  Osingunwa,  in Abeokuta. The Deputy Governor said the donation came as a surprise and a move taken appropriately as the coronavirus spread is an issue of concern, not only in Ogun State but across the country. He affirmed that though the state has few cases, the government has taken pragmatic steps in tackling its spread and that Mouka’s goodwill would immensely boost the level of facilities at the isolation centres. The State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker said health issues are paramount to the government and assured that the products would be effectively utilised for the wellbeing of the citizens. Corroborating his views, the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs,  Barr. Femi Ogunbanwo,  said the government has not relented in its effort towards providing quality healthcare for the state and that the mattresses would be used to equip the COVID-19 isolation centres. Mouka’s Chief Commercial Officer, Dimeji Osingunwa, stated that the socially responsible organisation lent its support during this period of national crisis as the wellbeing of Nigerians at the core of Mouka’s mission. Osingunwa added that this necessitated earlier donation of 700 mattresses to Lagos State Government for COVID-19 isolation centres and to victims of Abule Ado gas pipeline explosion which occurred in the state recently. Mouka has also joined in appealing to citizens in the country to adhere to measures at combating the spread of COVID-19. As far back as early February 2020, Mouka had begun raising awareness for Corona Virus prevention on its social media platforms. The company advises citizens to wash their hands regularly, stay at home, and keep to social distancing guidelines when in public, among others. vanguard Coronavirus crisis in Nigeria escalated yesterday as the number of cases hit 89.
