Mene did not say whether there was a new targeted implementation date, and left the conference call before the question and answer session. It is obviously not possible to commence trade as we had intended on 1 July under the current circumstances. The 55-nation continental free-trade zone would, if successful, create a $3.4 trillion economic bloc with 1.3 billion people across Africa and constitute the largest new trading bloc since the World Trade Organization formed in 1994. Mene said he was confident the deal would still go forward. “The political commitment remains, the political will remains to integrate Africa’s market and to implement the agreement as was intended,” he said. Mene said that as African governments do not have the firepower to launch the same type of economic stimulus packages that the United States and Europe are putting forward to mitigate the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, intra-African trade could serve the same purpose. “That’s our stimulus package. That’s how we’re going to get back on track as Africa.” Africa News Vanguard By Yinka Kolawole,  with agency report The implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement will not begin on July 1st  this year as planned due to disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic.
