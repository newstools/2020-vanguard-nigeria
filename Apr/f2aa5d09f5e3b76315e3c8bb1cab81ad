A statement by the association’s leadership on Sunday morning said, among others: “By midnight Sunday, April 19, 2020, all export facilities will stop operation as well as suspension of production and maintenance services reports. “By 12 noon on Monday, 20th, all our members will withdraw all forms of services relating to crude oil production, refining, distribution and supplies.” However, in a statement after the 22 offshore staff ExxonMobil were released, President and General Secretary of PENGASSAN, Ndukaku Ohaeri and Lumumba Okugbawa respectively, said among others: “On Thursday, April 16, 2020, we raised the alarm over the illegal arrest and detention of 21 (19 male and 2 female) ExxonMobil personnel by the Rivers State Police Command. “They were arrested on the pretext that they violated the state’s movement restriction order put in place to curtail the spread of COVID-19. The allegation runs contrary to the letters of the said order, which expressly exempted oil and gas workers on essential services. “Recall that we issued an ultimatum dated April 18, 2020 notifying all stakeholders that we had directed all our members to withdraw all forms of services relating to crude oil production, refining, distribution and supplies effective 12 noon, Monday, April 20. “At about 9a.m. this (Sunday) morning, with the intervention of relevant authorities an unconditional release was secured for all our members held hostage in a most horrible and inhuman condition since Thursday, April 16, 2020 by Rivers State Government Authorities. “Having achieved the primary demand in our ultimatum, we hereby suspend the planned industrial action.
