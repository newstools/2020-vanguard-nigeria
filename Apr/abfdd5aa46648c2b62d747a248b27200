Some Nigerians are bewildered on social media following the official Twitter handle of the Ministry of Finance and Budget begging for ventilators from industrial engineer, Elon Musk.

Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla  know.” We have extra FDA-approved ventilators.
