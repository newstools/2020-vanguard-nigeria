Disney Martinez is living it up, and it’s a hard-earned and well-deserved celebration she’s having. The 31-year-old is a mother of two and half of the marriage-powerhouse-duo FitCouple. She built her success from the ground up with her husband Jorge by her side, and she does not intend to take a break from her meteoric rise to the top any time soon. In between her dedication to her own self-taught fitness routine, her incredible personal successes as a marketing master of her company, and her most prized and pride-inducing role as mother of two, Disney is more than content to live the life of luxury she has cultivated for herself. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1384485 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=640%2C960&#038;ssl=1" alt=" Disney Martinez Fitness" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=39%2C58&amp;ssl=1 39w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=129%2C194&amp;ssl=1 129w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fitness-2.jpg?resize=87%2C130&amp;ssl=1 87w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Moving from her birthplace in Havana, Cuba to the United States at age 15, Disney set out to take full advantage of the American Dream story at the core of this country’s identity.
