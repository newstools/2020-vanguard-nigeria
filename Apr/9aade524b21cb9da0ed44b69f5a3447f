It added that the N20,000 which covers payment for the months of January, February, March and April, will be paid to each of the beneficiaries through Direct Cash Transfer, as it has been done in a few other states of the federation.

He said the lockdown had impacted the finances of many income earners and had consequently expanded the population of the vulnerable group in the State.
