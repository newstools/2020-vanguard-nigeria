He observed as things now stand, the palliatives package might not serve its purpose saying the majority of the people who were supposed to benefit from the exercise have not. And the very few that have had access to the items complain that it was nothing to write home about. According to him, “Two things might have given rise to this fiasco. It’s either the items were not generously provided by the authorities or those assigned to do the distribution did not acquit themselves creditably. If it is the latter, then it is indeed a national tragedy as it is fast becoming our national ethos. “Take the way relief materials meant for the Internally Displaced Peoples (IDP)  camps are routinely abused and you will get the point I am making here. We are not generous in this country and when we are entrusted with the responsibility of dispensing what governments have made available to people in distress, we make sure that the goodies do not get to the people they are meant for. “We are callous, greedy and wicked that is why the IDP camps are suffering deprivations today.

He applauded Governor Sanwo-Olu of Lagos state who is doing everything within his power to address the situation. “The Governor of Lagos state has lived up to expectations during the ongoing emergency. These are the times we know great leaders”, he said. He however urged both federal and the 35 states governors to ensure that the distribution of the palliatives is closely monitored by trusted aids. “That is the only way your very good intentions will percolate to the masses you love very dearly”, he said. vanguard By Ebunoluwa Sessou Nigerians have continued to lament over the ‘Stay at Home’, the order of the Federal Government as, for them, there are quite a number of issues that were left unattended before the restriction order was initiated. “What should concern us  are the palliatives to be given out… April 9, 2020 In "Woman's Own" The Lagos State Government has confirmed the authenticity of Short Message Service (SMS) messages forwarded to residents who are 60 years and above as part of measures adopted in the distribution of stimulus food package in the state.
