Officials said at least 116 people initially cleared of Covid-19 had tested positive again days later. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) say the virus may have ‘reactivated’ rather than the patients becoming re-infected with it. The cause of the apparent relapses remains under investigation. But some experts have suggested faulty tests may be to blame for the alarming results. Others have pointed to remnants of the bug still in the patients’ systems which are not infectious or any danger to themselves or others. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, a clinically recovered coronavirus patient should test negative twice 24 hours apart. They pledged to investigate the apparent rise in cases of people testing positive again, which almost doubled from 51 to 91 last week. In a statement, the agency said: ‘We are closely liaising with our clinical experts and working hard to get more information on those individual cases. ‘It is important to make sure that when samples are collected for testing on suspected patients, procedures are followed properly.’ Meanwhile, the government has hinted that lockdown restrictions could soon be eased, but urged South Koreans to stick to them until then. The current guidelines, which call for people to stay at home, avoid social gatherings and only go out for essential reasons, are expected to remain in place at least until April 19. But more and more people have started flouting them as the number of cases has dropped and the weather has improved. Following a meeting on Monday Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said: ‘Later this week, we plan to review our intensive social distancing campaign that we have carried out so far and discuss whether we will switch to routine safety measures.’ However, he was quick to warn that even when the restrictions are eased, the country will not return to life as before the outbreak. He added: ‘We need a very cautious approach because any premature easing of social distancing could bring irreversible consequences, and have to ponder deeply about when and how we switch to the new system.’ Source: UK Metro Vanguard Nigeria News South Korea reported on Monday that at least 116 people initially cleared of the new coronavirus had tested positive again, although officials suggested they would soon look at easing strict recommendations aimed at preventing new outbreaks.
