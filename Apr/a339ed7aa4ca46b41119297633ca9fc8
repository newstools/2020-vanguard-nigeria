Before that, the heads of each of UEFA’s 55 member associations will come together next Tuesday to look at developments across both domestic and continental competitions. UEFA is also set to meet with the powerful European Club Association (ECA) and the European Leagues grouping on Wednesday. The meetings could bring confirmation of the postponement of the next women’s European Championship by a year to 2022 — following the earlier decision to postpone the men’s Euro to 2021 — but any other firm decisions may be unlikely.

On Wednesday, Scotland announced an early end to the season in the three leagues below the Premiership, with current league leaders declared champions. The resolution also allows the ruling SPFL board to call the Premiership as it stands — Celtic are top — if it determines the remaining games cannot be played, but they will be waiting for further guidance from UEFA.
