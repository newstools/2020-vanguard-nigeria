The British-based team will also use the UK government’s furlough scheme to guarantee 80 per cent of salary for staff up to a maximum of £2,500 ($3,000) a month. “The McLaren Group is temporarily furloughing a number of employees as part of wider cost-cutting measures due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its business,” said an official spokesperson for McLaren. “These measures are focused on protecting jobs in the short-term to ensure our employees return to full-time work as the economy recovers.” The opening eight Grand Prixs of the 2020 season have been cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is still hope the season can resume at a later date with F1 CEO Chase Carey optimistically aiming for a calendar of 15-18 races.
