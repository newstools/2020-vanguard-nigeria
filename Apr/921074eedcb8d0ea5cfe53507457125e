The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina Mohammed-Baloni, said on Thursday that the new cases were the Quranic education pupils (Almajiri) who came to the state from Kano. Mohammed-Baloni said that they tested positive to COVID-19 from sample of 40 people whose test results were released on Thursday. “These latest cases have raised the number of active COVID-19 cases in Kaduna State from nine to 25. “The high numbers of positive results from persons with travel history from outside the state, confirms the Kaduna State Government’s fears. “The state government had expressed fear about the danger of infection from neighbouring states, and the role of interstate travel in facilitating the spread of COVID-19 across state lines,” she said. The commissioner said one of the 17 cases announced by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was a repeat test from an existing patient, and we have drawn their attention to it and it would be rectified. “As part of the implementation of the preventive measures, our health officials are monitoring suspected COVID-19 cases, believed to have sneaked into the state in spite of the ban on interstate travels. “The Ministry of Health wishes to draw attention to the appeal made by the State Standing Committee on COVID-19 to security agencies to accelerate the blocking of entry points into the state. “Effective enforcement of the prohibition of entry into Kaduna State as outlined in the Quarantine Orders is clearly a key success factor in efforts to avert the nightmare scenario of community transmission. “We wish to draw the attention of the public to the provisions of the Quarantine Orders and the penalties for any willful contravention,” the commissioner said. She appealed to the public to be vigilant and kindly report returnees from states with high infection rates by contacting officials of the ministry. Mohammed-Baloni also encouraged such persons to contact the ministry officials so that they could be monitored, saying that failure to do so might make such persons liable to the processes prescribed for violators in the quarantine orders. “The Ministry of Health welcomes the approval granted by the Kaduna State Government for the payment of Occupational Safety Incentives to our frontline health workers as well as the provision of enhanced life and disability insurance packages,” she said. The commissioner reminded the public of the importance of handwashing, personal hygiene, social distancing and the avoidance of large gatherings in helping to protect us all from COVID-19 pandemic.
“It is important to stay home, stay safe and save lives,” she added.
