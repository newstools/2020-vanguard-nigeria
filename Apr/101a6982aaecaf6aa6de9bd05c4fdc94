And when Foreign Minister Kang Kyung was asked separately if Seoul has notified President Trump about the despot’s condition and location, she said the commander-in-chief was in touch with South Korean officials and “should have been notified,” according to the news outlet. Kang later clarified that Trump was aware of Kim Jong Un’s condition but not his whereabouts. During a White House briefing on Monday, Trump said he knew how Kim is doing, adding that the American people could find out in the “not-too-distant future.” “I can’t tell you, exactly — yes, I do have a very good idea, but I can’t talk about it now. I just wish him well,” the president said. Earlier Monday, North Korean state media published a purported letter from the Hermit Kingdom’s leader in a bid to dispel rumors about his health. The 36-year-old despot hasn’t been seen publicly since April 11 and missed the April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of his grandfather, North Korea’s founder Kim Il Sung.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s minister for North Korean affairs suggested Tuesday that Kim may have missed the celebration due to concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, not because of an illness. “It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim Il Sung’s birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns,” Unification Minister Kim Yeon-Chul said at the parliamentary session, Reuters reported. He added that there were at least two instances since mid-January in which Kim was out of sight for nearly 20 days. “I don’t think that’s particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation,” he said.
