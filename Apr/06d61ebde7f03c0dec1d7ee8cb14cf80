We thank President Buhari for giving us attention by sending a powerful delegation in order to see that our efforts are strengthened. “Our major problem is an ineffective testing centre. We have to thank President Buhari for fixing that. Also in the next few days we would have additional testing center in the Bayero University Kano. “We commend the house of representatives members who made efforts to write a letter to the President requesting for special for the Kano State government to address the pandemic. They also unanimously passed a resolution “We have also met with private health facility owners on the need to be coordinated and connect them with the emergency operation centre in order to get data in regard to COVID-19. On our part, we promised to assist them with PPE. “We are collaborating with Lagos State. No doubt they were able to end Ebola, Lassa Fever and now COVID-19. We have similarities in terms of population and others with them. And I can assure you, very soon the collaboration will swing into action,” the Governor said. Earlier, in a meeting with operators of private facilities in the state, Governor Ganduje told the health workers not to send away patients who come to their facility with symptoms of COVID-19 for medical attention.

According to him, “don’t send away patients who come to the facilities with symptoms of COVID-19. This is because sending them away will not help the situation at hand. “You can always find a way of reporting such patient to appropriate authorities to handle such cases,” Governor Ganduje said.
