China’s technology industry enters a new year after weathering unprecedented turbulence in 2019, when giants emerged in social media and artificial intelligence only to bear the brunt of Washington’s campaign to contain the world’s second largest economy. There’s little reason to think 2020 will be much different given US efforts to hobble Chinese champions from Huawei Technologies to SenseTime Group deemed a threat to national security. American lawmakers went after some of the country’s biggest names last year.
