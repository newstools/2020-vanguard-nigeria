The promoter, identified only as Kenneth, claims several attorneys have reached out to offer their services in suing the “VIBEZ” artist, 28. He currently plans to pursue legal action against everyone involved, claiming the incident left him with cuts and bruises his face, TMZ reports. Kenneth claims he was hired to organize a party for rapper Stunna 4 Vegas at a Florida nightclub, with DaBaby — real name Jonathan Kirk — agreeing to host at a discounted rate of $30,000. The promoter then showed up with $20K, promising to hand over the remaining $10K at the end of the night, leading the impatient spitter to get violent over the balance. The Grammy nominee was also detained in North Carolina on Dec. 23, hours after hosting a toy drive, with Charlotte-Mecklenburg police issuing citations to DaBaby for misdemeanor possession of marijuana and resisting an officer. In December, Kirk told reporters he believes officers unlawfully searched his car while he was performing that night. Video obtained by WCNC-TV shows the rapper being detained in the parking lot. Kirk said officers target him every time he comes to Charlotte, and that his video team had captured footage of their own depicting the incident. “They follow me, they pull us over for no reason, they search our cars,” Kirk said.
