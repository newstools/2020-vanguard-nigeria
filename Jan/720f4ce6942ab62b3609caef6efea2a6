The attack was ordered by Mr Trump and in defence of his action, the US president said the action is necessitated to ‘stop a war’. “We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. “I have deep respect for the Iranian people. They are a remarkable people, with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential,” Mr Trump said. Born, Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, the 27-year-old has never been a fan of the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Cardi B is a strong fan of Democrats presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders. She endorsed Bernie Sanders ahead of the 2016 election. The rapper according to Time report featured in live coverage of the US 2016 presidential election. When the election was seen swinging in the direction of Donald Trump, Cardi said; “Trump got me nervous because he might take my shmoney away!”. In April 2018, Bernie Sanders confirmed Cardi B’s support for his American vision; “Cardi B is right. If we are really going to make America great we need to strengthen Social Security so that seniors are able to retire with the dignity they deserve.” <img class="wp-image-1316793 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B.jpg?resize=515%2C194&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="515" height="194" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B.jpg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B.jpg?resize=58%2C22&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B.jpg?resize=260%2C98&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B.jpg?resize=200%2C76&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B.jpg?resize=560%2C212&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="wp-image-1316795 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B1.jpg?resize=530%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="530" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B1.jpg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B1.jpg?resize=58%2C22&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B1.jpg?resize=260%2C98&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B1.jpg?resize=200%2C76&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B1.jpg?resize=560%2C212&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B1.jpg?w=603&amp;ssl=1 603w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The backlash between the two African countries (Nigeria and Ghana) made Cardi B, one of the trending keywords on twitter. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1316796" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Twitter-Trend-Cardi-B.jpg?resize=403%2C317&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cardi B trending on Twitter" width="403" height="317" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Twitter-Trend-Cardi-B.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Twitter-Trend-Cardi-B.jpg?resize=58%2C46&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Twitter-Trend-Cardi-B.jpg?resize=247%2C194&amp;ssl=1 247w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Twitter-Trend-Cardi-B.jpg?resize=165%2C130&amp;ssl=1 165w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Twitter-Trend-Cardi-B.jpg?w=313&amp;ssl=1 313w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Cardi B also joked on the tribe she will choose on arrival in Nigeria.
