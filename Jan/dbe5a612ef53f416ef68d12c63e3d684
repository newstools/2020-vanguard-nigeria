The son of the Kaduna State governor, Bello el-Rufai, said on Wednesday he was trained to destroy his opponents. He stated this on his Twitter handle -@B_ELRUFAI – while responding to those who taunted him on the arrest of a former senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial district, Shehu Sani, for alleged extortion by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC arrested Sani on Tuesday for allegedly collecting $10,000 from a businessman under the guise of helping the man to resolve his problem with the anti-graft agency. The governor’s son said:  “There are reports that former Senator and current contender for best blogger of 2019, ‘Comrade’ Shehu Sani has just been arrested by the EFCC operatives on a fraudulent related case. There’s a limit to how deceit under the veil of populism can take you. A leopard and spots.” A Twitter user later responded, saying he knew Bello would “love this news more than anyone else” and the governor’s son said: “I was trained to destroy my opponents.”  Vanguard A little drama played out, Thursday, at the launching of the Kaduna Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, in the state when the Senator representing Kaduna Central, Senator Shehu Sani angrily walked out of the event after sighting the Kaduna state Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai who… July 6, 2017 In "News" The Kaduna State Government has said Senator Shehu Sani did not come to the Thursday launching of the Kaduna State Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC hence could not have walked out.
