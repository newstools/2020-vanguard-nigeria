The step, according to the YWC Secretary-General, Prof. Anthony Kila, in Lagos on Saturday, would help ensure that the outfit remains people-centered and people-owned. “The YWC is calling on people of goodwill and all those that are free from hatred and mischief to express their support and suggestions as well as highlight their concerns or doubts on Amotekun,” he said. Prof Kila also added that such suggestions, concerns, and observations would be channeled to the table of those charged to manage Operation Amotekun across all Yoruba states. He, therefore, charged individuals and groups to send their messages via the website of the Yoruba World Congress. “We as a people called for Amotekun and now that we have it, we must treasure it and defend it with all we can. We must make Amotekun work. There might be imperfections, concerns or doubts, but as a people-oriented and people desired initiative it is our right and duty to let our voice be heard on Amotekun. “We, therefore, call on all people of goodwill and all those that free from hatred and mischief to express their support and suggestions as well as highlight their concerns or doubts on Amotekun. We promise to get your thoughts to the right quarters. We also promise to monitor operation Amotekun and to ensure it remains noble, just and fair.” vanguard Mok By Dayo Johnson A solidarity walk organised by the Yoruba World Congress (YWC); an umbrella body of all Yoruba Socio-cultural and Self Determination Groups in support of Operation Amotekun, a security network recently established by Governors from Western Nigeria to wage war against the spate of insecurity ravaging the… January 19, 2020 In "News" AKURE—HUNDREDS of diverse Yoruba interest groups, yesterday, in Akure, Ondo State; Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State; Ibadan, Oyo State; Osogbo, Osun State and Abeokuta, Ogun State, heeded the call by Yoruba World Congress, YWC, and rallied in support of Amotekun, the security outfit set up by the governments of the South-West to… January 22, 2020 In "News" ABUJA— THE Six South West governors, weekend, declared that they will not "capitulate to blackmail" from within or outside the region, and reaffirmed that the South West security initiative, Amotekun, is neither a regional army nor an ethnic agenda aimed at obliterating and undermining national cohesion.
