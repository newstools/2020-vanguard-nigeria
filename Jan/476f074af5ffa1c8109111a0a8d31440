The playmaker suggested the former club captain has a better connection with the Arsenal players and that he feels rejuvenated under the Spaniard. Ozil whose £350,000-a-week contract ends at the end of next season has been linked with a move to Fenerbahce but insisted he is going nowhere. He told the Mirror: “I am very pleased with my contract that will continue here this year and the year after. “I can’t tell you what the future will bring, I’m excited about the future, but I don’t know what’s going to happen.” Ozil’s troubled spell continued after Emery had left when in December he went completely missing in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City and angrily kicked his gloves as he walked from the pitch. Ozil insists things are different under Arteta, who lifted two FA Cups as a player at Arsenal and served as captain from 2014 until his retirement in 2016. Ozil added: “I had a hard time, especially with the previous coach Unai Emery, but now everything has changed, and I am very happy with everything. I play regularly and everything goes well. “Arteta, as I said in my previous interviews, it was surprising to many people that he adopted the club in such a short time. He’s doing a good job. He’s hungry for success. “Everything about him is positive. Arteta’s story is a bit different because I don’t remember when she quit football, but it hasn’t been over that long. In this way, players can understand more easily.” Source: Football 365 Vanguard News Mesut Ozil will travel with Arsenal for their pre-season tour of Singapore, the Gunners' new head coach Unai Emery confirmed on Monday.
