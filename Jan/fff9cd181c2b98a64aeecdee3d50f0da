Paul Pogba underwent surgery on his ankle injury on Tuesday, reporting that “everything went well” during the operation in a social media post. The Manchester United midfielder initially posted a video on Instagram in which he looked groggy and admitted: “I don’t even know if I’m OK or if I’m high or if I’m sober, just don’t ask me if it went well, I don’t know.” He later deleted that post and replaced it with a shorter video. “Everything went well,” Pogba said. “We have to keep the positive energy.” Pogba, 26, is expected to be out for another four weeks after suffering his second ankle injury of the season.
