Fourth-placed Chelsea have a five-point advantage over United while Spurs and Wolverhampton Wanderers are a further point adrift. However, Pulisic, who has scored five times in his first season with Chelsea since his £58 million transfer ($76 million) from Borussia Dortmund, says Chelsea must put right their lack of accuracy when chances pop up. “We said at half-time that we had the chance to kill the game and we just weren’t able to,” said Pulisic. “We couldn’t get the goal and in the end they found an unbelievable goal. “So now it is about doing a bit more to keep going, attack and create chances and just have that killer instinct. Just a little bit of that, we are missing that.” Pulisic, who earlier in the season became the youngest Chelsea player to score a hat-trick in the 4-2 win over Burnley, says he is as much to blame as the others. “I can do better with that as well,” said the forward. “Just being more clinical in the final third, finding the right pass or shot and scoring the goals. That’s both mental and technical.” VANGUARD Christian Pulisic says he wants to make the same impact that Eden Hazard has had at Chelsea and hopes to play alongside the Belgium superstar at Stamford Bridge.
