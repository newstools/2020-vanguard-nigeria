Here are five series that held us spellbound this decade and are all currently available for streaming on Showmax. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1316729" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=600%2C377&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nigerian TV Series" width="600" height="377" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=768%2C482&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=58%2C36&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=260%2C163&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=200%2C126&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=160%2C100&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ajoche.jpg?resize=560%2C352&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" />  Ajoche
