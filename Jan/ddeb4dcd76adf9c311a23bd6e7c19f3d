This is coming on the heels of the World Health Organisation, WHO, the decision to designate 2020 as the ‘Year of the Nurse and Midwife’. The Physicians under the World Medical Association, WMA, through its President, Dr. Miguel Jorge said they were proud to work in multi-disciplinary teams providing the best health care necessary. “Our nursing colleagues are strong partners in helping patients and communities, and together we make a difference. ‘Nurses and midwives are often the first health professionals to see a patient, and sometimes the only ones. On his part, the WMA Chair Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery added that for healing patients and the best care, for palliation and rehabilitation, for community care and prevention, nurses and midwives are an essential element in the chain to deliver health care. “We hope that declaring 2020 as the “Year of the Nurse and Midwife” is more than just tokenism and lip-service. There is a severe lack of nurses in many countries, and in most places, nurses and midwives are undervalued and underpaid. Nurses are desperately needed to provide nursing care. “We hope and expect governments to take the necessary steps to improve the working and living conditions of nurses and midwives so that they can provide the services for which they have been educated.” vanguard The National President Association of General Private Nurses Practitioners, AGPNP, Balogun Ajiboye has traced Nigeria’s poor health indices to underutilisation of nurses and midwives despite the World Health Organisation’s recognition of midwives as skilled labour.
