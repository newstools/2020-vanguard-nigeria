The kidnapping of crew is not just a phenomenon faced by one sector of shipping. All types of vessels have been targeted at various distances from the coastline. “The last quarter has seen 64 crew kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea in six separate incidents with 19 and 20 crew taken in two incidents in the first half of December. Both incidents were more than 100 nautical miles from the coast. Whilst contributing to the overall numbers, there can be no doubt that the Gulf of Guinea presents a serious and immediate threat to the safety and security of crew and vessels operating in the region. “All four vessel hijacks occurred in the Gulf of Guinea along with ten of the 11 vessels that reported coming under fire. There has also been a recent spike in the activity in Singapore Straits with 11 of the 12 incidents for 2019 reported in the last quarter.” From the report, Nigeria recorded a drop in the attacks against vessels on its waters as 48 vessels came under such attack in 2018 while 35 were recorded for 2019.
