Ozil, 31, who was recently tipped to be heading for the exit door at the Emirates, was accorded a standing ovation on Sunday by fans despite the 2-1 loss to Chelsea. “Mesut was very effective against Chelsea.

And he’s willing, that’s what I can tell you. He’s been showing it in training. The structure has to help him to be able to take everything he has inside. “On his own he cannot do it, he needs the collective and the structure around him and his team-mates. “There’s only one or two players in the world who can do it on their own. He needs help.” Arsenal go into the New Year’s Day match in 12th place, already 11 points off the Champions League spots. They are also just six points above the relegation zone.
