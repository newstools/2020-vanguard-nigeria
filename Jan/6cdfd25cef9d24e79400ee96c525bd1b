The 32-year-old Bosnian international has just returned to the Premier League after spending the first half of the season on a temporary deal in Azerbaijan with FK Qarabag. Begovic, who won the Premier League title with Chelsea in 2016-2017 despite playing just two league games, has agreed a six-month contract until June 30, AC Milan said in a statement. “Begovic will join his new teammates tomorrow (Tuesday),” the Italian outfit added. Former Liverpool and Napoli goalkeeper Reina, whose contract with Milan runs until 2021, only played once for the club this season. The 37-year-old former World Cup winner saved an injury-time penalty in a 2-1 win against Genoa last October.
