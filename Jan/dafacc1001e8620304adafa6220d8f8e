Tesla Inc became the first $100 billion publicly listed U.S. carmaker in extended trading on Tuesday, in a sign of Wall Street’s confidence in an all-electric future.

In another win, Tesla reached a settlement with Michigan to allow it to directly deliver its vehicles to customers in the state, a person familiar with the agreement said on Tuesday.
