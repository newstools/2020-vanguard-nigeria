Delivering a lead judgement, Justice Hamiru Sanusi held that Ottiâ€™s appeal lacked merit and was liable for dismissal. Other Justices on the panel agreed with the opinion of Justice Sanusi on the matter. The Owerri division of the Appeal Court had dismissed the appeal of Otti and declared Governor Ikpeazu as the validly elected. The Appeal Court had upheld the judgement of the Election Petition Tribunal which had earlier declared Ikpeazu as the duly elected Governor of Abia State. Similarly, the elections of Governos Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta state, Ishaku Darius of Taraba and Abubakar Bello of Niger state were affirmed by the Supreme Court. Vanguard Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, who was sacked by the Appeal Court, sitting in Owerri, Imo State, has said that he has the right to remain in office pending the outcome of the suit he filed at the apex court (Supreme Court), to challenge the annulment of his victory.
