Tottenham manager Mourinho grabbed headlines with his barbed comments about Sparkes following a surprise 1-0 Premier League loss to Saints on New Year’s Day. The Portuguese could face a frosty reception from home fans on Saturday when he returns to St Mary’s for an FA Cup fourth-round tie. Saints boss Hasenhuttl, who has repeatedly spoken of his admiration for Mourinho, feels no animosity towards his fellow coach and revealed the controversial incident has provided a source of humour. “I don’t think so, it’s emotion, they are part of the game,” replied the Austrian when asked if he expected the argument to resume. “Jose is a fantastic guy and Andrew is also a fantastic guy. “It was a running gag after the game, also in our office, but he is a good guy and I think this is normal sometimes in a game, that emotions are coming up. “But don’t hang it too high, I think.” Mourinho received a yellow card from referee Mike Dean after a touchline altercation with Sparkes. His frustration boiled over due to perceived time-wasting from Southampton as he watched Tottenham labour in defeat and lose star striker Harry Kane to a long-term injury. Speaking immediately after the game, the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss said: “I think the yellow card is fair because I was rude, but I was rude to an idiot.” That impressive win for resurgent Saints, secured by an early Danny Ings strike, is part of a run of seven victories from 11 top-flight games that have propelled the south coast club away from relegation danger. Hasenhuttl hopes to see a handshake between Mourinho and Sparkes ahead of the rematch. “Yeah, maybe, yes,” he said.
