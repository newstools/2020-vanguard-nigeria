He called on members of the public to support the command by giving them vital information in order for them to achieve better in 2020. “We are going to do better this year than in 2019 because we have synergies with other sister security agencies as we’ve always done. “We are also appealing to members of the public to support us and give us information that will enable us keep the society safe,’’ Adie said. Mr Femi Joseph, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, who was promoted from SP to CSP commended the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Police Service Commission for the promotion. Joseph said that the promotion would encourage them to give their best to Nigerians and the Force and pledged commitment to live up to the expectations of the new rank. “I want to say that my colleagues and I will continue to live within the ambit of the law and ethics of Nigerian police and promised to do much more much better than before,’’ Joseph said.
