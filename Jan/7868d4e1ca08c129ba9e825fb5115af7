Not only is the C&I Leasing Rights presenting a better offer in terms of pricing, it is also rewarding in terms of the number of shares that existing shareholders are getting. Subscribing to the C&I Leasing Rights Offer will entail that a shareholder will be paying N24 for 4 additional shares that are worth N29.2 in the market, which is a gain of N1.3 per share.
