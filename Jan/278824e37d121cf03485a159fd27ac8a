An unidentified man grabbed a backpack belonging to Iverson, 44, containing the bling from the lobby of the Sofitel Hotel on South 17th Street early Monday, Philadelphia police said. “The scene was held and the investigation is active and ongoing with Central Detectives Division,” police said in a statement to The Post. “No further information at this time.” Iverson was not present at the time of the theft, sources told WPVI. It’s unclear why the former NBA MVP and 11-time All-Star was at the hotel, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Detectives are now searching for a suspect described as a 20-year-old black man believed to be 6 feet tall. He was last seen wearing a dark jacket, red shirt, dark pants and black-and-white sneakers, police said. Iverson, who formally retired in 2013 after last playing in the 2009-10 season, spent the bulk of his storied career in Philadelphia before stints in Denver, Detroit, and Memphis. Anyone with information about the theft is asked to call Philadelphia police at (215) 686-3093.
