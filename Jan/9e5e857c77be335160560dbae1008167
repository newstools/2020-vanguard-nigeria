The National President of the Arewa Consultative Forum, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, made the call while reacting to the New Year speech by Buhari. Shettima said that despite concerted efforts by the military to end the ravaging insurgency in the north, the security situation in the region was far from desirable and needed more strategic approach to contain the challenge. According to him, the federal government needed to overhaul the security architecture and rejig it to be able to deal appropriately with the security threats in the north and other parts of the country. Shettima reasoned: “It is only when people are alive and happy that there can be governance. What we have today in Nigeria in terms of security is really worrisome. “That is why we are asking for the total overhaul of the entire security apparatuses in the land with a view to bringing in other people with new vision, zeal and commitment to deal with the security challenges in the country,” he said. The ACF leader also suggested the adoption of new economic strategies and measures to bail the nation out of its current state in order to bring in new investments, revive the industrial sector and create jobs for teeming Nigerians Following criticisms that trailed the appointments made so far by President Muhammadu Buhari which many argued were lopsided in favour of the north, the president, yesterday, dismissed insinuations that he was implementing a northern agenda in his appointments.
