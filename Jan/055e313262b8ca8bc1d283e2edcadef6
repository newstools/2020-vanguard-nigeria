Britain believes the Iranian nuclear deal remains the best way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapon, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday. On Sunday, Iran said it would abandon limitations on enriching uranium, taking a further step back from commitments under the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal. “It is our view that the JCPOA remains the best way of preventing nuclear proliferation in Iran, the best way of encouraging the Iranians not to develop a nuclear weapon,” Johnson told parliament. “We think that after this crisis has abated, which of course we sincerely hope it will, that way forward will remain. “It is a shell that has currently been voided but it remains a shell into which we can put substance again.” Vanguard News Nigeria Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he had new "proof" of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme, as the US considers whether to quit a landmark atomic accord that Israel opposes.
