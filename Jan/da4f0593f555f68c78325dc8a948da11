In his ruling, the presiding judge, Justice Simon Amobeda said the defendant had shown “exceptional circumstances” to permit the Court to exercise its discretion and admit him to bail. The terms include a bail bond valued at N10 million with two sureties in like sum. One of the surety must be a civil servant with either the State or Federal Government on Grade Level 13 or above while the other must be a “close relative with a verifiable address,” Justice Amobeda ruled. Also, both sureties are expected to depose to an affidavit and provide two passport photographs. The defense team was for the first time, comprised of more than one lawyer with E. E. Osim, Oliver Osang, and Assam Assam jr who represented the Abuja branch of the Nigerian Bar Association all entering appearances. The matter was stood down for a few minutes after it was called due to the absence of the Prosecution Counsel, Dennis Tarhemba. However, another prosecutor from the Cross River State Police command, C. I. Eze entered an appearance for the prosecution. Justice Amobeda held that bail pending trial remained a right enshrined in the constitution. He held that the counter affidavit of the prosecution was “bare” as the deponent is a police officer who “has no expertise in medicine.” He ruled that the “mere claim” of the prosecution that the defendant/applicant was not sick was not enough to discountenance the material evidence placed before the court by the defense.
