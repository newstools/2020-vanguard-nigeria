Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu has reassured the people of the state that despite gimmicks of detractors, the multi-sectoral progress and development witnessed across the 18 Local Government Areas of the state will not be put on reverse.

Shaibu said, “This is the time for Edo people to choose if we want progress; our progress must not be put in reverse. Some persons want to stop Edo State from progressing but this is the time to defend Governor Obaseki and Edo people. “We are for good governance. We have a governor that has redefined good governance and is doing all he promised the people during his campaign. We promised to take good governance to the next level and we are doing it.” He continued, “Obaseki is positively transforming the state through his people-oriented policies that have birthed programmes like Edo State Basic Education Transformation (EdoBEST), Edo State Healthcare Improvement Programme (Edo-HIP), and the Edo Oil Palm programme in the agricultural sector. “He has made giant strides, which now positions our state as an investment destination.
