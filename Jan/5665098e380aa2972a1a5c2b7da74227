The Nigeria international made his 18th appearance in the Spanish top-flight this term and was on parade at the Reale Arena for 82 minutes. Chukwueze could not add to his tally of three league goals this campaign but he won a penalty that inspired Villarreal’s fight-back in the second half. Goals from Manu Trigueros and Santi Cazorla, in the 58th and 72nd minutes, respectively, sealed the visitors’ eighth league win of the season. Before his substitution, Chukwueze completed the most key passes and dribbles for the Yellow Submarine. Cameroon’s Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa was in action from start to finish while his compatriot Karl Toko Ekambi watched on as an unused substitute. Villarreal moved to ninth after the victory with 28 points after 19 matches. Their next game is a Copa Del Rey fixture against Orihuela on January 11.
