The woman’s grandson, in his 30s, was questioned at the scene and detained pending further investigations. The fire brigade said it was called on Wednesday evening to a house in an isolated hamlet in the Haute-Vienne department of France. They managed to put out a fire, which was contained to a single room, but were at first unable to find any occupants in the house. Firefighters and police searched the property and found the mutilated corpse of the 83-year-old in the freezer, one source with knowledge of the investigation said. The grandson, who was at the house, made conflicting statements to police, a second source said. A post mortem examination will be carried out as part of the investigation.
