Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed Wilfred Ndidi had a successful surgery and has started his recovery process. The Super Eagles star, who has been a key member of the Foxes squad this season, suffered a knee injury in training on Tuesday. The 23-year-old combative midfielder subsequently missed his side’s League Cup tie against Aston Villa on Wednesday night. Rodgers affirmed the former Genk man will be expected to be out of action for between three and four weeks. “It went very well,” Rodgers told the national media, ahead of Saturday’s Premier League game against Southampton. “It was a good operation. He’s now back in and straight into his recovery. Something around that [three or four weeks]. Sometimes it can be sooner, sometimes it can’t be.” The Nigeria international has made 24 appearances across all competitions this season before the injury setback.
