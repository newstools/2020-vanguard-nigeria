The summit which is hosted by the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, according to the organisers, is expected to bring together African leaders, international business chief executives and heads of international organisations. A statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina said that the event is also expected “to create new partnerships that will deliver more investments and jobs” to the benefit of people and businesses in African countries and the United Kingdom. According to the statement, “Apart from highlighting new perspectives on UK-Africa Partnership for Prosperity, issues of Sustainable Finance and Infrastructure; Trade and Investment; Future African Growth Sectors and Clean Energy and Climate, are expected to dominate presentations and discussions during the Summit. “With the expected take-off of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in mid-2020, the London investment summit will provide Nigeria with the opportunity to project itself as a leading investment destination for new industries. “In addition, the summit will deepen Nigeria-United Kingdom investment ties post-Brexit given that Africa currently represents just two per cent of British trade activity, with Nigeria accounting for only 10 per cent of that total. ” The Nigerian delegation to the investment meeting will further showcase what the Federal Government has done through policies and legislation to improve the investment and business climate in the country.” Adesina said that while in the United Kingdom, President Buhari will hold a meeting with the Head of the Commonwealth, Prince Charles in Glasgow, Scotland. ” The President and his delegation will also have bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Johnson as well as heads of multilateral organisations,” he explained.
