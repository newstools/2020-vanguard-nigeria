Just weeks after the Fenty Beauty founder, 31, split from longtime billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel, she’s moved on with rapper A$AP Rocky, The Sun reported. The duo was reportedly spotted getting close in New York City this month. “They shared a hotel suite during that trip in New York,” a source told the outlet. “However, Rihanna is reluctant to put a label on it as it’s so soon after Hassan. They’re really enjoying each other’s company and taking things easy as it’s still early days.” The source added, “It’s really casual between them and she’s not thinking about whether there’s a future with Rocky. She’s a newly single girl having fun.” Reps didn’t immediately return Page Six’s request for comment. She and Jameel dated for three years. Shortly after the split, she was spotted at the same event as Drake, but a source told us they were not dating again. In 2013, Rihanna was spotted getting close with Rocky at Soho House. “They were playing pool and hanging by the stairwell,” a spy said at the time. “They weren’t kissing or anything, but they were looking very friendly.” The “Praise the Lord” rapper, 31, previously dated Kendall Jenner.
