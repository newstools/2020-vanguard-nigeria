The Athletic journalist David Ornstein claimed on Thursday that Arsenal were ‘in advanced talks’ to sign Kurzawa with Raul Sanllehi ‘leading the negotiations’ for the defender. The France international joined PSG in 2015 from Monaco for €23m but has been used as a rotation option in his time with the French champions. Sead Kolasinac and Kieran Tierney are both injured currently and the Gunners transfer team are looking to bring in some defensive support for Arteta. Kurzawa is out of contract in the summer and Arsenal could sign him for free – but Ornstein added that they ‘intend to sign him immediately’. However, Tuchel says that Kurzawa will play against Lorient on Sunday and reckons PSG “need” the defender. “I haven’t spoken with Layvin or anyone else about his departure this winter,” Tuchel told reporters. “Layvin is number two behind [Juan] Bernat in the left-back position. We need him and Layvin will play tomorrow (Sunday) against Lorient. “He has played well recently.” Source: Football 365 Vanguard News Arsenal are closing in on a deal for Paris Saint-Germain left-back Layvin Kurzawa, according to The Athletic journalist David Ornstein.
