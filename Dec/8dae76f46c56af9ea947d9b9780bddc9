Mayweather, the undefeated retired boxing superstar, announced on Instagram Sunday that he will step back into the squared circle to fight Logan Paul in a boxing exhibition match on Feb. 20. The event, which has reportedly been in the works for a while, will be exclusively available on Fanmio pay-per-view.
