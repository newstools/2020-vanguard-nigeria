It’s best to shutdown this madness now before it gets messy. The citizens will not take lightly to this and a reasonable admin will not worsen an already bad situation. Arrest these rogue officers and prosecute them for armed robbery & kidnapping.  https://t.co/FfEHh46nmm — SEGA L’éveilleur® (@segalink) December 21, 2020  EFCC is fighting cyber crime on the streets and NDLEA SWAT is searching for drugs in people’s phone..

Some say na drugs dem dey operate for Lol so we don dey carry drugs for Gmail now? Wey dem Dey search phone? — MeeYoung (@MrMeeyoung) December 21, 2020  So they ended sars and put NDLEA swat on the road. To check if people have drugs in their phones or what? It would be nice if the actual NDLEA could speak on this because it doesn’t look good on them at all — Ọládipúpọ̀ (@uncledips) December 21, 2020  NDLEA SWAT operates just like the disbanded SARS. They stop people and search their phones and laptops. The problem isn’t about the name but bad work ethics with total disregard from human right and privacy.
