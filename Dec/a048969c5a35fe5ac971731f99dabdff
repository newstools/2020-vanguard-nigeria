SP Ishaku, who stated this at the commemoration of Human Rights Day organized by the Zuma and Aurora Flotila Decks of the National Association of Seadogs, NAS (Pyrates Confraternity) in Abuja, said that seizure or prevention of communication of suspects was illegal. Fielding questions on alleged human rights abuses by the Police, he said “every suspect has a right to communicate in the language the police understands with his lawyer or family.” Also answering questions on why personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, molest and physically abuse motorists, an Assistant Corp Commander, Olusola Asonibare, said the corps has stringent disciplinary mechanisms for dealing with such officers.

Segun Atanda, who represented the Vehicle Inspection Officer, VIO, stressed the need for the public to give maximum support and cooperation to officers on duty as this makes the work of policing society and traffic control a lot easier.
