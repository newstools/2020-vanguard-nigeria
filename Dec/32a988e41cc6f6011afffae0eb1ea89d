They spoke at the 2019/2020 Graduation Ceremony and Prize Giving Day at the Redeemer TEAP School on Saturday in Abuja. They called on the Federal Government and stakeholders to join hands in fulfilling the goals and aspirations of the education sector through increased budgeting. Mr Dimeji Yusuf, Principal of the school said that it was critical for governments and stakeholders to address the education budget so as to make provisions for more infrastructures toward a knowledge-driven economy. ” We need a big budget for the education sector and I believe the Federal Government is up to the task to fulfil that which has been the objectives of making the budget big for the development of the sector. ” I appeal to the Federal Government and all stakeholders to put in all efforts to ensure an improved budget to tackle the challenges caused by budget deficit. What we are experiencing in some of the schools in the cases of not having enough facilities for teaching and non teaching aids will be addressed. ” They need to follow up with the budget and make sure that all facilities for adequate learning are put in place for the progress of the nation,” he said. Yusuf added that there was also the need to address the security challenges especially in the education sector so that both students and teachers can be comfortable anywhere they found themselves either learning or teaching. According to him, if the security of the education sector is put in place , there will be a good foundation of the education sector which the present generation and generation to come can enjoy.
He, therefore, advised the graduands to always aim high and give what it takes to soar higher in their education in years to come irrespective of the challenges encountered on the journey to greatness.
