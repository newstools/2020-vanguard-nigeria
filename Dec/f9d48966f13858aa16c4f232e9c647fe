In the speech entitled “Identifying the Political Interest of the Igbo of the South-East Geo-Political Zone in Nigeria and Strategies for its Actualisation,” Anyim noted that between secession, the Presidency and restructuring, people have wondered what the Igbo wanted. He said for the South-East region, only a President of Igbo extraction matters most at the moment. On how to achieve the goal, Senator Anyim said: “The task is achievable if approached collectively and adequately. “Most importantly, to strengthen the capacity of the Igbo of the South-East geo-political zone to negotiate and ultimately win the Presidency, there is an urgent need for civic and voter education to increase voters’ turnout. “The South-East is currently the zone with the least voter turnout, and this should change. Institutions like the World Igbo Summit should actively promote voter education and civic engagement. “Moreso, every Igbo organisation and association should arise and promote voter education and civic engagement.
