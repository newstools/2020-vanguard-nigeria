China has largely curbed the spread of Covid-19 within its borders, but authorities remain highly vigilant about the threat of “imported” virus cases. “Given the exceptional nature of the virus mutation and its potential impact … China has suspended flights between China and the UK after full assessment,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a routine briefing.
