Ayade who spoke with journalists shortly after casting his vote at Ward 004, Kakum Town Hall, Ikpong Obudu Local government area said he was impressed with the turnout. Ayade said that from what he has seen so far he was impressed with the turn and believes the Senatorial/ State House of election would be free and fair in all the five LGAs His words:” I have just cast my vote, as usual, this is my family playground, this is where I vote. This is the traditional stronghold of my political structure. “I believe that we will have success in Jesus Name. I am impressed with the turn out even though it is still early in the day. From the perspective of my ward, I can say this election is free and fair. “If this is the situation across the entire senatorial district, then we have a real and fair election “Electronic voting is the way to go basically speaking. The issue of rigging has become a very critical issue taking into cognizance the recently concluded American election. It is clear that we must keep improving our strategy on how to make our election temper prove. “So I’m of the strong view that electronic voting is a critical option and I know the national assembly is already doing something about it. To see how they can make the election full prove. To ensure that it is difficult to rig. “Because if people(politicians)know that it is through the instrumentality of people’s votes that the get into office, they will be more accountable to the people. “But if you know that there is another short cut method other than the peoples’ vote, then once they assume office, they don’t care because they got into the office through inordinate means. That is why vote must count so that those who are elected are accountable to the people,” he said.
