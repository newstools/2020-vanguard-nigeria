Muyiwa Adekeye, Special Adviser to the Governor (Media & Communication), in a statement, explained that the state government called for collective action with citizens to curb the infections without having to resort to extraordinary measures like a lockdown. The government believed that mass compliance with COVID-19 prevention protocols should suffice to help reduce the rate of infections. Amidst the reality of a second wave of Covid-19 infections, the Kaduna State seeks to prioritise public safety while preserving the ability of citizens to safely pursue their livelihoods. All residents of Kaduna State are urged to practice personal responsibility and abide with simple
prevention measures. The COVID-19 prevention measures are outlined in the FORWARD campaign:

d. Wash hands with soap under running water and or using hand sanitizers
e. Avoid large gatherings and crowded spaces
f. Remain indoors when there is no need to be outdoors

government to reinstate and tighten some of those provisions.
