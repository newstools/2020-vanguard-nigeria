This survey, as disclosed by the organizer is to foster greater standardisation and integration in MSMEs as a way to explore all opportunities embedded within African territories and Nigeria’s economy. AfCFTA in collaboration with other stakeholders known as Organized Private Sector of Nigeria, OPSN comprised of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture, NACCIMA, Nigeria Association of Small-Scale Industrialists, NASSI, among others recently held a virtual meeting to launch the survey brief to bridge the gap that exists in the MSMEs and African Trade. This gap as observed has hindered total participation and gains embedded in the African trade for MSMEs to benefit hence the launch of the survey report. According to the survey, MSMEs remain critical constituents of the Nigerian economy as they represent about 96 percent of Nigerian businesses and contribute 75 per cent to national employment. It went on to add that MSMEs can benefit from greater access to new markets and the possible economic transformation that competition could promote. Focusing on four key sectors, wholesale and retail trade, the agricultural and food processing sector, manufacturing and service sectors, CIPE said these sectors were selected given their high business potential and contributions to GDP, employment and exports. Decrying the low level of awareness regarding the existence of the agreement among MSMEs, it said there is a general optimism surrounding the prospective effects of its implementation among the minority aware of the agreement. Director of education, Governance research, Center for the Study of Economics of Africa (CSEA), Dr Adedeji Adeniran, said modest positive welfare gains to Nigeria with machinery, other transport, textile and metal products as well as textile industries account for most of the positive effects on real wage with the agreement.
