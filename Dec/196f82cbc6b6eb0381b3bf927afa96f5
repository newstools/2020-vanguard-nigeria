The new products are expected to hit the Nigerian Water and Beverages market through the company’s wide distribution channels following the recent commissioning of the of the State-of-the-Art manufacturing plant located at the Ikotun/Igando axis of Lagos State.

Our brand philosophy is to right the wrong in our society by helping people to break free from the usage or consumption of products that have long term adverse effect on their health”. “Our products are natural, and we have been able to deliver this in our Body Care and Foods products. Now we are bringing the same philosophy to our new Water and Beverages products. We will be launching Avilan Table Water and Drinks as part of our commitment to ensure that Nigerians get the very best quality and natural products that are not only healthy and safe for consumption but also enhance their overall wellness.” Avilan Water & Beverages products are manufactured under a conducive environment, in compliance with very stringent processes and procedures that conform to Good Manufacturing Practices with State-of-the-art equipment and machineries.
