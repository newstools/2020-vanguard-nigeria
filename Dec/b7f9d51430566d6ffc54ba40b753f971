The Pope on the Christmas day, offered the faithful the traditional papal blessing “Urbi et Orbi’’ (to the city and to the world). “We are all in the same boat,’’ the Pope said from the Benediction Hall at the Apostolic Palace, where he gave his address instead of from the central balcony of the basilica, to crowds in St Peter’s Square.
