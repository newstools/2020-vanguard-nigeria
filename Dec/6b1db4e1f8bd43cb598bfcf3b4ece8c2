 Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 induced economic hardships, leading companies in the Nigerian Stock Exchange numbering 95 have turned out combined gross earnings of N6.01 trillion in revenue for the first nine months of the year (Q3’20), a 1.97 per cent rise above the N5.89 trillion recorded in the corresponding period of 2019 (Q3’19). Gross profits also rose marginally to N1.61 trillion, 1.69 per cent from N1.58 trillion recorded in 2019. Two out of the three quarters in the period saw Nigeria’s economy in the negative gross domestic product, GDP, at -6.1 per cent and -3.62 per cent in Q2’20 and Q3’20 respectively, thus sliding into its second recession in five years. Most businesses were either shot down completely or partially due to the COVID-19 while the entire macroeconomic environment came under siege of revenue crunch arising from the crash in the price of crude oil, the economy’s main life line. Though the combined results of the companies outperformed the economy the individual performance shows that most of them suffered declines in earnings and profit with a good number of them recording losses. Specifically, 44 companies recorded pre tax profit while 21  recorded losses. Also economy analysts have indicated that the pressure on corporate performance is not yet abetting adding that the banking sector’s figures in the fourth quarter, Q4’20, may be affected adversely due to bad loans and the provisioning that would be made in the full year audited account. But the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele, has stated recently that the country is on the path of recovery given the reduction in the rate of slide in GDP in Q3’20. He further assured that Nigeria would be out of recession in the first quarter of 2021, Q1’21 as both the fiscal and monetary authorities are doing everything possible to revitalize the economy.

Analysts/operators’ reaction Reacting on the performance of the 65 listed companies on the Exchange relative to GDP, Managing Director of APT Securities Limited, Mallam    Garba Kurfi, said: “The reason why the companies’ combined gross earnings and pre tax performed better than the GDP was due to devaluation of naira. If converted into USD Dollar the return will have been in a negative. The exchange rate was move from N306/$ to N380/$ an increase about 24 per cent. The naira value has been depreciated that make absolute figure as an increase in the performance.” On why the banking sector outshined other sectors, he said: “The banking sector has less effect from COVID-19 because, their loan to customers keep up accruing interest despite COVID- 19 pandemic. However, the performance of banks may be drawn back by the end of the year due to increase of bad loan and likely increase in the provision of bad loan may bring down their performance low    by the end of the year.” On projection for Q4’20, Kurfi said : “My projection for the year that NSE All Share Index, ASI will likely closed for the    Year ended December 2020 in double digits which is now    confirmed with 30 per cent    gained by the end of November, 2020 . Therefore, Q4 performance of the market will be the ever best in the last 20 years of the history of the NSE. The last two months October to November the ASI gained 30 per cent .It is unique not only that bond are trading at a premium of 50 per cent and above which was never done in the Nigerian capital market.” In his own reaction, analysts and Executive Vice Chairman, HIGHCAP Securities Limited, Mr David Adonri said: “Nigeria’s economy fell into stagflation in Q3’2020. During the period, several businesses experienced negative growth just like the economy. Some businesses were resilient and weathered the storm. Some businesses with certain peculiarities actually benefitted from the woes of the economy. The 96 quoted companies that outperformed the economy belong to this group. They probably belong to enterprise groups with elastic demand for their products irrespective of price hike. The COVID-19 disruptions actually heightened the demand for services that operate through virtual channels like telecommunications and banking. It is not surprising that banks dominated in the out performance of the economy because their transactional flows through virtual channels increased tremendously during the lockdown. They may also have benefited immensely from depreciation in value of the Naira during the period.” In his projection for Q4’20, he said: “Post lockdown, the economy has been normalizing, save for EndSARS disruption and continued rampage by bandits and Boko Haram. As economic recovery reshapes the business environment, the possibility is high that companies which survived COVID-19 lockdown stronger will also end the year strongly. The only doubt relates to the quantum of non- performing loans arising from impact of the pandemic on beleaguered borrowers. If these have not yet been provided for, at year end, the real figures for bank profits will become apparent.” Reacting as well, analyst and Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion said : “The proactive move of the government and CBN to intervene in critical sectors of the economy by way of bailout and reduction in tariff helped to reduce the negative impact of coronavirus outbreak on the system. This was a reflection in marginal improvement in gross domestic product from a contraction of -6.1 per cent in Q2 to -3.62 per cent in Q3. This slight improvement shown on corporate earnings that pushed equity prices up as a leading indicator. Also, the industrial output as measure by Purchasing Manager Index, PMI show uptrend for that period to cross the 50 points in November to 50.2 points. On why banks dominated other sectors, he said: “The banks are the engine room of any economic development and growth of any nation, so the sector drives activities in the system. Improvement in the economy impacted positively on the banks performance which was what we saw in Q3’20 numbers despite the pandemic. It shows that our banks are resilient and stable” In his projection, Omordion said: “I expect a better number in Q4’20 and mixed performance. As companies are likely to cut dividend, while few will grow their payout. Companies that have equalisation dividend policy may not cut dividend but maintain their previous payout.”  Against the backdrop of the new Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) as well as impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on businesses, provision for bad loans in banks rose 64.4 per cent to N155.8 billion cumulatively in major banks in the first half of the year.
