Umaru disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sideline of the 2020 International Human Rights Day Celebration in Katsina on Thursday. He explained that the cases received during the period under review included assault, rape, domestic violence, and breach of trust, among others. In celebrating the 2020 International Human Rights Day, he urged the people not to relent in reporting human rights abuses to the commission for appropriate action. Umaru said that the commission would continue to pursue human rights with vigour because it remained the bedrock of human dignity. “I, therefore, enjoin stakeholders to make concerted efforts to join the rest of the world to end discrimination and marginalization of any kind, hatred, molestation, nepotism, ethnicity, among others,” Umaru said. Earlier in a remark, the Chief Judge of Katsina State, Justice Musa Abubakar, said that the International Human Rights Day was aimed at sensitising the public on their rights and privileges. He explained that the NHRC was expected to investigate and bring cases of abuse such as sexual violence in schools, cheating on the vulnerable such as women, children, and the poor to courts for trial. Abubakar, who was Chairman of the event, commended the NHRC for its sensitization of the general public on human rights and urged them to keep it up. The theme of the 2020 International Human Rights Day was “Recover Better – Stand Up for Human Rights”.
