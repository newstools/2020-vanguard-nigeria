This is even as stock dealers have said that re-opening of the land borders by the federal government would add more impetus to market recovery. Though they believe the re-opening may not directly impact on the market, but they said that the expected positive effect on the macro economy would eventually rub off on the market. “Federal government did not do enough impact assessment study before closing the borders. The policy harmed Nigeria more than the benefits expected. “Re-opening the borders now will enable Nigeria come out early from current economic stagflation. Whatever impacts the economy positively is a capital market enabler,” said David Adonri, Managing Director/CEO, Highcap Securities. Corroborating him,  Mallam Garba Kurfi, Managing Director/CEO, APT Securities and Fund, said that the earnings of many of the manufacturing companies that trade their products across the borders, whose activities were stifled in the last 15 months due to the closure, would be lifted,  thereby resulting in long term positive impact on the market as investors react to the outcome of the resumed trading on their earnings. “The opening of the borders may not have direct impact on the stock market but indirectly, yes because many manufacturing companies have their products trade across the country,” Kurfi said.
