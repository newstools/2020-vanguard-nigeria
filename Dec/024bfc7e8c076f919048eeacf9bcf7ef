This is to allow governmental and other accredited agencies to be able to access anybody’s details from the national database when required. If you have never registered for the NIN, you will need to visit any National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) office closer to you. However, make sure when visiting, you adhere to all COVID-19 prevention protocols: Failure by some Nigerians to adhere to this has made the NIMC shut down some of its centres. *SHUT DOWN OF SOME ENROLMENT CENTERS* Dear esteemed applicants, The NIMC wishes to inform members of the general public that some enrolment centers were shut down today.
