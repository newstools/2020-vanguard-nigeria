He added: “Journalism is massively taking a new dimension in the face of digital migration, making it imperative for reporters to have an analytical mind and be well informed in the beats that they cover.” The NAJA training workshop is an annual training programme, organised to refresh the minds of practicing auto journalists on the trend of auto journalism worldwide.
