The expressway has been experiencing traffic snarl for years but the situation has taken a turn for the worse since Tuesday. Security personnel are indifferent as they hide under shades and trees, watching motorists groan in pain. <img class="size-full wp-image-1503111 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa2.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa2.jpg?w=1008&amp;ssl=1 1008w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa2.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa2.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa2.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1503110 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa1.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa1.jpg?w=1008&amp;ssl=1 1008w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa1.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa1.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apapa1.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Vanguardngr.com We are tired of the activities of these military men who have refused to leave despite a presidential order.
