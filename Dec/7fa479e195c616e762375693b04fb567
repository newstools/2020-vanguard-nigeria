Well, whatever stones represent, they need to be “rolled away” to ensure a seamless transition into what we desire. Ejiro Gray, Lawyer and Company Secretary at energy conglomerate, Sahara Group, captures engaging thoughts about how to handle ‘stones’ in her maiden book titled “Roll Away the Stone”. In this interview, Ejiro speaks about her motivation to write the book, authors and books that have shaped her life as well as how working with Sahara Group empowers her to excel professionally while also having the freedom to develop her non-work attributes in the pursuit of self-expression and contribution to bringing energy to life The journey started roughly 7 years ago, but it didn’t take an aggressive turn until the last quarter of 2019. I got the title through a revelation around a particular chapter of the book, what is now chapter 7. It underscores the difficulty of standing in faith in the face of undisputed facts. At the time I started writing, I had just discovered Isaiah 54. I had spent time reading it and I felt a burning desire to share these promises with others by bringing it home to them in a simple and relatable manner. Descriptive and poignant Is there really a “best time”? I am not sure, however, there is an African proverb that says “whenever a man wakes up is his morning”. In this context, that basically means, we should focus on developing the courage to roll away the stones holding us back and the timing should not be the focus. What is most important is getting it done. That would have to be Chapters 5 and 7. I personally learnt quite a bit from them and in the course of the year, I found myself going back to read excerpts over and over again to remind myself of the nuggets of wisdom. I think it boils down to Trust. The ancient hymn trust and obey says it all. It is the only way to get through to the other side. Believing against all odds that God loves us and wants what is best for us. But we must understand that the path He chooses for us may not be according to our ideal script, especially because we exist in a fallen world, but that is where trust and yielding to Him comes in. Trusting that though it makes no sense to you at that point in time, possibly because you feel crippled by the situation, there is a purpose to everything that happens to and for us, because He loves us. It is written that “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). We have to believe that and release the pain and confusion to Him when life doesn’t make sense. It’s never easy when you are walking through fire, but He reassures us that we have the victory, if we yield to and trust in Him. I am a lawyer and one thing lawyers and writers have in common is the love of language. Both professions thrive on playing with words and giving life to them to achieve a particular purpose. My training as a lawyer naturally translates to my writing skills. The Sahara Group does have a volunteer policy that encourages employees to give their time and resources to charitable and social causes. Beyond that, as an organisation, creativity is a core part of our DNA and so it is not surprising that the people who make up the entity called Sahara, have diverse skills and expressions of creativity which the organization and humanity, benefits from. As such, we are encouraged to express and celebrate our uniqueness through our gifts in order to explore and attain our highest potential, individually and as a cohesive group. The graduate trainee programme offers you a unique platform on which to define your destiny. You are given a blank canvas (the training platform) an easel, some brushes and paint (practical work and life skills) crowned with experiences that can best be described as avant-garde) with which to start out on an interesting journey of self-discovery, development and unusual opportunities in a rapidly expanding energy conglomerate. Too numerous, but to mention a few, the Bible as it helped shape my values and my faith, Enid Blyton Books opened up my imagination and love for reading, African Writers Series made me fall in love with African proverbs and my heritage, Reader’s Digest from the age of nine, opened up my mind to diverse areas of interest such as medical research and general knowledge, Tim La Haye’s “Why you act the way you do” helped me understand my personality and idiosyncrasies. Chinua Achebe, Chimamanda Adichie, Cyprian Ekwensi, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa thiongo, and Mabel Segun. All for their storytelling skills, use of language and ability to immerse the reader in the story. There is a saying that “a good book makes you want to live in the story, a great book leaves you with no choice”. The latter mirrors the effect that their books have on me. They leave me with no choice but to live in the stories. I think the beauty of being a writer is there is always a project or concurrent projects in the pipeline, so I’d say “watch the space” and let’s see how it all unfolds.
