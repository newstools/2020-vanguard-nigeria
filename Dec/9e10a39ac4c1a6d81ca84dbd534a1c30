It was gathered that the Baale of Aba Tuntun had earlier petitioned the police, informing them that some people within his community were in possession of firearms, which they reportedly use for illegal activities in the area. The police, after receiving the petition, swung into action by conducting a raid with 15 officers and 35 local vigilantes on Thursday. The source said during the raid, six single barreled guns, 16 dane guns and 15 cartridges were recovered from the hoodlums, who were arrested by the police. Trouble however started when the villagers allegedly waylaid the police officers as they were about to leave the community. “The villagers fired gunshots at the police and attacked them with other dangerous weapons” “The DPO that led the team and some other policemen sustained gunshot injuries. “Four officers and three vigilantes were kidnapped by the villagers. They made away with two AK-47 riffles, one pump action, one teargas, money and others,” the source said. Also, the hoodlums who were earlier arrested by the police were set free, while two vehicles belonging to the police were damaged by the villagers. It was gathered that three of the four abducted officers and three civilians have been rescued, while one Constable, Emmanuel Gene is still being held captive by the people.
