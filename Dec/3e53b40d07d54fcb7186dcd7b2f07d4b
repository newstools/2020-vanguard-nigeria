Breathing: Tune in, listen to the rise and fall of his breath as you make love and discover what really turns him on. Calories: Need a reason to make love? A single passionate kiss can burn 12 calories and 20 minutes of energetic sex burns up to 160! Daytime Sex: Taking a rainy afternoon off work-to make love feels so naughty you’ll be smiling for days. Educate each other: Despite all the films we’ve seen and the books we’ve read, no one knows it all. A willingness to listen and learn will reap-many rewards. Fidelity: Faithfulness creates a trusting environment – one in which you can relax, explore and savour sex even more. Giving:Good sex is about give and take. Talk to each other. Ask about his secret desires and tell him yours. Honest: Don’t take it. If you’re not achieving orgasm, gently explain what you need in order to get there. Interlude: A build up increases pleasure, so have the odd ice cream or wine break before you go for full intercourse. Jealousy: Don’t let wild imagining ruin things for you and discuss any problems before they destroy your love. Kissing: Don’t limit yourself to lips- try the neck eyelids, toes and earlobes. Laughter: If you can laugh together, in and out of bed: you’re well on your way to being a good couple. Mid-cycle sex: Research has shown that around ovulation, women feel much sexier and are keener to take the initiative in bed. Nipples: When women are aroused, the diameter of their nipples can increase by half a centimetre, and breast can swell up to 25 per cent bigger than their normal size. Orgasms: These get better with age. Ninety per cent of women over 45 report they regularly experience orgasms through love-making, and have more multiple orgasms. Privacy: If there are children in the house, ensure that you won’t be disturbed. Shut the bedroom door or fix a lock. Quickie: Sex doesn’t always have to be a marathon. Ring the changes.
