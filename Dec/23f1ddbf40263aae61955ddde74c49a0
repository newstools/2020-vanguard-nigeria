On the 1st of December 2020, EbonyLife Place reopens as the premium event space in Lagos for the most elegant and exclusive occasions, conferences and exhibitions. We also reopen our Luxury Cinemas, the Turaka rooftop restaurant and bar and The White Orchid Hotel, our boutique, designer hotel. We deserve to celebrate life now more than ever, even as we adhere to the strictest guidelines to ensure the safety of you and your guests. To allow for maximum flexibility, when hiring our spaces, event planners and organisers are now allowed to appoint their own chef, culinary team, mixologists and waiting staff, all of whom can work out of our world-class facilities behind the scenes.
