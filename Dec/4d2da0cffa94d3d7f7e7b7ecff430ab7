Atiku Bagudu, Chairman, Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), who turned 59. Similarly, the party felicitated with former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara on his 53rd birthday. In a statement by Mr John Akpanudoedehe, Secretary of the Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) in Abuja, the APC noted that Bagudu had contributed to its growth and that of the PGF. Akpanudoedehe said the Kebbi state governor had displayed uncommon vision and participatory leadership, which positively impacted the human capital development of the state while strengthening the party and the PGF in line with its progressive ideals. He also said that the APC was proud to identify with Dogara due to his exemplary private and public dealings, having proven himself as a patriotic and grassroots politician. He added that Dogara had constantly displayed time-honoured attributes of decency, transparency, hard work, Integrity, and a people-centric posture. “Undoubtedly, Dogara’s recent return to the APC is a major signpost that the Gov. Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC is achieving its core mandate to reposition the party,” Akpanudoedehe said. He added that the committee was also addressing grievances and achieving true reconciliations across the party’s rank. “The APC family prays for Bagudu and Dogara’s good health and wisdom to undertake their public and private endeavours,” he said.
