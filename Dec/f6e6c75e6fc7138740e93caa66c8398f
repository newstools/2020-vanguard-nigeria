According to her: “I have had strong women in my life who have provided the platform for me to rise beyond my challenges. My Master’s thesis was on women and how they cope with challenges and life generally. It is important for women to have confidence in themselves. “Women should strive to be independent and never be a burden on society.  In Nigeria being a woman is at a disadvantage because we are referred as second-class citizens already. Women should also endeavor to obtain sound education, which no one can take away from them. “They need to have the courage and confidence to face life. They should not see themselves as inferior in any way. A lot of women are undergoing stress and they are unable to seek professional counsel and this causes a serious threat to their health. “Again, women should engage in profitable ventures and gain inspiration to live a fulfilled life“, she added. On parents especially women setting good examples for their wards, Edun explained that: “The role of women cut across the home and the society. On the impact of COVID-19, she said, “the investment in ICT has impacted positively on our students as well as our teachers. The role of technology cannot be underestimated in view of its relevance to accelerate the learning process.” Vanguard News Nigeria In keeping with its commitment to promote qualitative education and sustainable development in Nigeria, Keystone Bank Limited, has handed over a renovated and fully equipped Sick Bay to Dodan Barracks Primary School, Obalende, Lagos to manage remote health challenges of the students.
