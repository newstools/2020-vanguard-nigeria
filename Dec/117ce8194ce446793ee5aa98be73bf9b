Meanwhile, the NCDC disclosed that in the recent weeks there has been a huge increase in the number of samples sent to the National Reference Laboratory in Abuja from several states and the FCT. “This has led to an unusual delay with testing, but we’re working round the clock,’’ it said. The NCDC appealed to workers in laboratories across the states to continue with COVID-19 testing, so that most samples are not sent to its laboratory in Abuja. “Despite the very tough year, we appeal to health workers across the country to sustain the response. We remain committed to supporting states,” the NCDC said. (NAN) Vanguard News Nigeria The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has recorded 617 new infections of the COVID-19 in the country.
