The US recorded 165,151 new cases in 24 hours at 8:30 pm (0130 GMT Monday), the Baltimore-based institution said, bringing the overall total to 19,107,675 cases. The grim new milestone comes just six days after the US crossed the 18 million case threshold. The US also has a total of 333,069 virus-related deaths. Both the caseload and death toll are by far the highest in the world. Coronavirus cases have been surging at an alarming rate in the US in recent months.
