The convicts are Bashir Tukur, 20, Nawas Rabiu, 18, Mutar Umar, 20 and Abdullahi Isaq, 22. The Judge, Lawal Suleiman, sentenced the four traders after they pleaded guilty. He, however, gave them an option of fine. “They are to spend six months or a fine of N10,000 for conspiracy each, another N40,000 or 18 months each for theft and also a compensation of N37,500 each or another one year in prison,” Suleiman pronounced. He said that the sentence would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such acts.
