 Equity dealers have said that the mixed performance recorded in the stock market last week will persist even as investors gained N135 billion amidst profit taking in some highly capitalised stocks. Despite the profit taking in some blue chips that saw the local bourse dip in two of the trading days last week, the market still closed positive, aligning the development in other global  markets. Key global markets across US,   Europe and Asia had also seen some levels of appreciation within the week. In US (DJIA: +0.2%; S&P: +0.8%) closed in the green. European (STOXX Europe: -0.4%; FTSE 100: +1.9%) shares were mixed as optimism around the news of the UK’s approval of a coronavirus vaccine was partly offset by some profit-taking after the impressive November gains. Asian (Nikkei 225: +0.4%; SSE: +1.1%) shares closed higher on optimism over the vaccines. Analysts had posited that price corrections or pull back would be witnessed in the market in the  near future to strengthen the recovery process seen so far.

The gains in Airtel Africa resulted in rise in the All Share Index (ASI) to  35,137.99 points, a 0.72 percent increase from 34,885.51 points in the previous week.
