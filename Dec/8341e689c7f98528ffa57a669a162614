The terrorists were suspected to have come from Sambisa Forest, mounted on over 15 gun trucks and approached the town from different directions simultaneously. Troops responded and engaged the criminals with superior fire power. A statement from ADO ISA, Colonel, Deputy Director Army Public Relations 7 Division Maiduguri, said that the terrorists suffered huge losses both in men, materials and equipment.

Additionally,  3 boxer motorcycles, 3 Anti Aircraft Guns, 2 PKT Machine Guns, 10 AK 47 Rifles and 13 Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) Bombs as well as large cache of ammunition and other weapons were captured from the terrorists among others.
