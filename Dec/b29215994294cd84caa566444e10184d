He was part of the journey that brought our party to its formation, and ultimately the growth we have achieved in the last six years. “Whenever the party gave tasks to Dr. Sam, they were carried out dutifully and with the highest sense of responsibility. This indeed was the classic Sam; a hard worker who was passionate about the growth and development of his community, party and his country. “Mr Nda-Isaiah set industry standards as a media practitioner and publisher. He is forever a reference point for media practitioners in Nigeria. Like the motto of his newspaper, Leadership Newspaper, ‘For God and Country’, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah was driven by faithfulness to God and patriotism to the country in whatever decision he took, and Nigeria, as a country has been better because of Sam. “The country has lost a man full to the brim of ideas and solutions.
