The Director-General of the Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr. Lanre Mojola who stated this, said, “Weddings and social gatherings must not exceed 300 people with prior clearance from the Lagos State Safety Commission.” However, he said the measure became necessary in view of the spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in the state. Mojola said that the clearance is free and prospective couples will have to go on the Commission’s website to input the details of their weddings, adding that safety marshals will be deployed to such events to enforce all COVID-19 protocols to prevent any possible spread of the virus.
