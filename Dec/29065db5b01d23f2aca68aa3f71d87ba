But the state government has rebutted the allegation, saying that there was no iota of truth in it. In a video posted on her Twitter handle, the embattled woman alleged that the Commissioner attacked her as soon as she walked into her office on invitation for further probe into the case, adding that the Commissioner accused her of trying to smear her office. “Let the truth stand. I promised Nigerians that I will keep them updated as regard to Don Davis case. You called me to bring my phone for investigation and as soon as I walked in, you started attacking me, that why did I go on live broadcast? I asked you a question. Why did you bring me to your office to be attacked? Why retrieve my phone? What are we hiding? Which other evidence do you need?” Responding, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Comrade Iniobong Ememobong dismissed the allegations of attack and intimidation, saying that the government would not join issues with her on the matter. He said, “No such thing happened. The Commissioner for Education could not have intimidated her. It’s not in her character to do such thing. We refuse to join issue with the woman. I have spoken with the Commissioner for Education who told me that no such thing happened.” On whether the investigation will be thorough, transparent and dispassionately done, Ememobong gave the assurance that the report would not be skewed as it would be a true reflection of the matter. He said, “The investigation borders on things that are partly civil and criminal offences. So, the state government will undertake its part which is the civil offence, while the Police which I am sure you are already aware will handle the criminal part. There is nothing to hide. There is no interest to protect. The report will be reflective of the situation.” Vanguard News Nigeria Deborah Okezie, mother of Don Davis, a pupil of Deeper Life High School, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State has talked about being intimidated after she was summoned by the Commissioner for Education for further investigation into the alleged molestation of her ward.
