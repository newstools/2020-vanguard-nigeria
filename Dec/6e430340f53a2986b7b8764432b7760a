The authorities in Zimbabwe and South Africa met on 27 November and agreed to implement the strict health policy as a way of limiting the spread of coronavirus. “We are going to demand Covid-19 certificates,” Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa’s home affairs minister is quoted as saying. His Zimbabwean counterpart Kazembe Kazembe said: “If you know you want to travel in a few weeks, do what is expected of you so you do not have challenges at the border.” Travellers to Zimbabwe will be expected to present a negative Covid-19 test not older than 48 hours. The test costs $55 (£41) in a private laboratory. On their return to South Africa from Zimbabwe they must present a negative test not older than 72 hours. That test costs $60. The services are not widely available in public hospitals, the report says. Some Zimbabweans said they will use illegal routes to cross the borders, it adds.
