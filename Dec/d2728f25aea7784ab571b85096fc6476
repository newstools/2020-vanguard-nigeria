The victim’s mother, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “The Pastor came to our house to sell some drugs to me. Before he came, I had in mind to get something for the house. So, I left him and my daughter to go and buy those things. “When I got back home, I saw the Pastor using his fingers to insert inside my daughter’s vagina. I shouted and he said, it was the devil. I called people, who came around and started beating him. And eventually, he was arrested.” It was gathered that the defendant committed the offence at No. 39 Nsi Road, Abakaliki, in the Abakaliki Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, on  December 15, 2020.
