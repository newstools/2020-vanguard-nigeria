A letter to the Commissioner of Police by the APC signed y it the chairman and Secretary, caretaker committee of the APC, Col David Imuse (rtd) and Mr Lawrence Okah accused the state governor of obstructing the implementation of the court judgment which they said is declarative. Part of the letter reads: “Take notice that the said judgment is a declarative one which no Higher Court has held otherwise for now.
   “While counting on your proactive response in enforcing this judgment, please accept the assurance of our warm regard. Attached herewith is the certified true copy of the judgment.”
   Imuse had alleged in an interview that “Edo state has a governor who does not have one iota of respect for the judicial and legislative arms of government or the rule of law although he regularly runs to the courts on the most frivolous of excuses”. Justice Daniel Okungbowa of Edo high court had in a recent judgment declared as illegal, null and void the suspension of the Etsako East council chairman by the state governor, Godwin Obaseki. But reacting to the development, the Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chris Nehikhare said the state government had already appealed the ruling of the High Court. Nehikhare said “As for the complaint about the situation in Etsako East Local Government Area, the state government is exercising its constitutional right for an appeal and has, along that line, filed for an appeal. It has also filed for a Stay of Execution on that judgment. Therefore, the status quo remains and only the court can make a pronouncement on the matter and not the APC.” Vanguard News Nigeria ***APC on a wild goose chase - PDP By Ozioruva Aliu - Benin City Edo state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called for the resignation of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state over allegation of broken down security situation, disobedience of court order and that the state… December 21, 2020 In "Politics" Despite the recent Supreme Court judgment in favour of Edo State governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, it is not yet “Uhuru” for him as the state chapter of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has said that it was currently weighing the option of re-awakening its pre- election matters already in the court… July 13, 2017 In "News" The national leadership of APC yesterday set up a committee to screen its six governorship aspirants in Edo State, saying without prejudice to the work of the committee and that of the Screening Appeals Panel, the National Working Committee, NWC, has the final say on the fate of the aspirants.
