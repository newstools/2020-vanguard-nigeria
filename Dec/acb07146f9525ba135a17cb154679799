Also in his contribution, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, APC, Niger East said, “Looking at what has been appropriated, the Ministry of Defence; and the Armed Forces, most of what they would need has been considered in this budget. “And, if there’s no security in this country, the whole of this budget is as good as nothing. “So, this is a challenge to the Armed Forces of this country, that we at the National Assembly have done the needful. We must design a way to protect lives and properties,” Musa said. The Senate, after approving the Votes and Proceedings for Monday, 21st December, 2020, adjourned plenary till 26th January, 2021. In his remarks after the passage, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan said that the National Assembly would not accede to another request from the Executive to extend the capital implementation of the 2020 budget. Lawan who noted that the National Assembly’s approval granting extension for implementation of the capital component of the 2020 budget last week, should therefore be fully utilized by Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government, said that the extension of capital implementation of the 2020 budget till 31st March, 2021; alongside the implementation of the 2021 budget starting in January 2021, would guarantee sufficient injection of funds into Nigeria’s economy. The President of the Senate said, “For Nigerians, this budget that has been passed in the National Assembly today, is to ensure that the economy is supported fully through public expenditure, because the economy of our country depends largely on public expenditure. “The budget extension period for implementation of the 2020 budget, which we did last year, is to ensure that the funds that are available for 2020 are not lost. “So, there will be two budgets running; funds from 1st January, 2021, up to 31st March, 2021; and then the implementation of the 2021 budget itself to start from January. That is absolute fight against the recession we are suffering from. “With a projected 3 percent growth in our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 2021 budget, we believe that the recession which Nigeria is in will be over before the end of the first quarter.” Lawan, who urged the Executive arm of government to ensure the implementation of the 2020 budget till March 2021 as extended last week by the Legislature, however, warned that the National Assembly would reject any further extension request on the implementation of capital expenditure contained in the 2020 budget. He said, “I want to urge the executive arm of government, first to ensure that they implement the 2020 budget that will last up till 31st March, 2021. “There will be no extension after 31st March. Everyone must be on their toes in the Ministries, Departments and Agencies to ensure they implement the budget 2020. “And for 2021, we have to do everything and anything possible to ensure that we implement the budget like we tried to do in 2020. “I believe that the economy of Nigerians will receive the right kind of boost from the implementation of the two budgets.” Vanguard News Nigeria ABUJA- THE Federal Government told the Senate yesterday that President Muhammadu will present before the joint National Assembly, the 2021 Appropriation Bill.
