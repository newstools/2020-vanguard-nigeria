Ghislain Kikangalao, coordinator of the APLC anti-corruption agency “has been placed in preventative detention for the requirements of the enquiry,” the agency’s spokeswoman Chouna Lomponda told AFP. Kikangala was summoned to the prosecutor’s office in the afternoon, according to a letter seen by AFP. The APLC was created by presidential decree in March “to track down financial crime” in a country where corruption is endemic. However, after just months in existence, the agency found itself at the heart of a scandal involving an affiliate of the Nigerian Bank. The APLC had accused the Nigerian Bank of “money laundering and financing terrorism”, in effect substituting itself for the legal system, a lawyer for the bank said Wednesday. On December 10, APLC agents told the bank’s head, Arinze Osuashala, to place a $50,000 bond after detaining him and taking away his passport. before eventually taking $30,000, the lawyer Cibambo Amani said. The DR Congo presidency, in a statement, mentioned video footage in which people claiming to represent the APLC were handed a sum of money. The APLC confirmed that it had taken the $30,000 as bail and held on to the bank official’s passport.
