This move was as a result of a meeting on webinar with theme, ‘Status of Covid-19 Vaccines in Nigeria: Available Options and Opportunities for Public Private Partnerships’ organised byHFN with stakeholders in the healthcare sector in attendance to discuss plans for Covid-19 vaccination in Nigeria and role of public private partnerships and participation. The Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunimbe Mamora, explained what the Federal Government is doing and its plan and strategy as it concerns mass vaccination of Nigerians. Mamora made it clear that there are factors government is seriously considering He which includes availability, accessibility, affordability as well as acceptability of the vaccine by Nigerians. He said: “We are examining the procedure for administration and accountability and joined the COVAX facility to put Nigeria in a good position to access the vaccines in an equitable manner. “The agency that has been at the forefront of this planning is the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, NPHCDA. “Our projection is that by 2021, 20 per cent of the vaccine needs of the country would have been covered by the COVAX facility, while the Federal Government will cover another 20 per cent with the operational cost.” However, the Minister disclosed that Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Health is closely reviewing the efficacy of the vaccines now available including the cost in order to ensure it is safe for Nigerians. “We are reviewing the efficacy of the vaccines to ensure safety for our citizens and currently exploring the options of acquiring these vaccines through bilateral and multilateral engagement. “For example, we are engaging the World Health Organization, WHO, and the West African Health Organization, WAHO, in order to join countries towards large procurement at reduced prices. “There are a lot of cost factors, one of which is the storage cold-chain issue of some of the vaccines. Some of the vaccines must be stored in such cold temperatures that may not be possible cost wise. I “If we are looking at the vaccines that we will need to store at minus 70° then it may not be feasible cost-wise. So, we will be looking at the other vaccines that require temperature of minus 20° as opposed to the one that requires minus 70°”, he stated. Meanwhile, Director of Research, PharmAccess Group, and keynote speaker, Prof Tobias Rink De Wit, while speaking gave an in-depth explanation on what and how the Covid-19 vaccines look on a global perspective and better understanding.
