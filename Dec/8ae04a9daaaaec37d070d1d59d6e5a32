That’s because the driving force that made The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” Spotify’s top song of 2020 was a viral dance challenge on TikTok. As numerous countries went into lockdown in early 2020, the social media craze saw countless reluctant parents being dragged onto kitchen dance floors by toe-tapping and dabbing teens for a 15-second dance synchronized to the song’s punchy, 1980s-style synths. In the course of the pandemic that saw families spending more time online and less outside, the #blindinglightschallenge racked up 450 million views on TikTok, hands down beating the 295 million views for the song’s official music video on YouTube. Over on Spotify, the song picked up 1.6 billion streams this year, beating other hits like “The Box” by Roddy Ricch and “Dance Monkey” by Tones And I. But despite writing the song many homes will come to associate with the pandemic, the Canadian singer came only fifth among the most-streamed artists on Spotify. Ahead of The Weeknd, the most streamed artist among all Spotify users around the world is the Latin trap and reggaeton singer Bad Bunny from Puerto Rico, who collected more than 8.3 billion streams, according to Spotify’s annual review Wrapped. With his record “YHLQMDLG” he also made this year’s most streamed album, which was streamed around 3.3 billion times. American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish meanwhile claimed the title as the world’s most-streamed female artist for a second year in a row. In keeping with the lifestyle changes during the pandemic, Spotify noted dramatic rises in the number of home-haircut, work-from-home and garden-themed playlists. The audio streaming service Spotify, founded in Sweden in 2008, is the world’s largest music streaming service with more than 320 million users and a good 144 million paying subscribers in over 90 countries.

As multifarious factors–music streaming and wireless devices chiefly–conspire to reshape how and when we can listen to music, the mechanics of what is popular music is, and where it can conceivably come from, are also being fundamentally reexamined with the world becoming interconnected… August 18, 2020 In "News" The new coronavirus pandemic, (COVID-19) is giving humans around the globe a new perspective of life and in the face of this unprecedented crisis, TikTok is pledging $250 million to support front line medical workers, educators, and local communities deeply affected by the global crisis. April 20, 2020 In "News" Ten years ago, a 19-year-old singer left fans debating if the song ‘Holla at your boy’ was sung by a Nigerian.
