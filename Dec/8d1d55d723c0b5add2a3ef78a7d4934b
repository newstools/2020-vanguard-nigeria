They stopped the vehicle, and pleaded with them to reverse and take the right lane. “But instead, the defendants who were passengers, jumped down from the vehicle, ordered the complainants to leave the road saying that Nigerians do not need the police again. “When the complainants refused to comply, the accused descended and started punching them severally all over their bodies. “A police team on patrol, who received a distress call, stormed the scene and arrested the defendants,” he explained. Ogu said that the offences contravened Sections 168, 174 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 174 prescribes a three – year jail term for assault while Section 411 prescribes two years for conspiracy.
