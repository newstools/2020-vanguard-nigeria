Ujunwa Offiah is accused of conspiring with her boyfriend to stage her abduction, asking her family to pay N30 million. She was arrested along with another alleged accomplice, Precious Chukwu, 22, as the ransom money was being dropped, police said. “This is a case of conspiracy and staged kidnapping,” Lagos state commissioner of police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, said in a statement. AFP reported that Offiah’s boyfriend, an Uber driver and “the man at the centre of this case”, is still on the run. “We are going after him because he conspired with one of these two ladies, Offiah, who faked her kidnap.” Odumosu said that after negotiation, the ransom was reduced to N700,000.
