The UK’s true coronavirus (COVID-19) death toll is the highest in Europe and the second-highest in the world, according to new figures which suggest it is just under 40,000. New data shows 29,710 people had died of Covid-19 in England and Wales as of April 24, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It means the UK’s total two weeks ago was higher than Italy’s current toll of 29,079 and is second only to the US. On April 24, the Department of Health was reporting 22,173 hospital deaths in England and Wales as the UK hit its peak. The ONS’ two-week-old total is about 35% higher than previously reported, meaning the true death toll could be closer to 38,500 as of Tuesday. The data also confirmed Covid-19 deaths in care homes soared by more than 2,500, or 36%, in the space of a week, but the overall toll trended down due to fewer deaths in hospitals. The report also revealed the second highest weekly death total recorded in England and Wales, which was 11,539 more than the five-year average. Almost 30,000 coronavirus deaths as of April 24 In a report released on Tuesday, the ONS said 28,272 residents of England had died of coronavirus as of April 24 and 1,376 residents of Wales had died for a total of 29,648. It rises to 29,710 when non-residents are included. April 8 was the deadliest day with 1,318 deaths in all settings in England and Wales. The ONS total is about 35% higher than the Department of Health total reported at the same time. This is because the ONS figures include all mentions of Covid-19 on a death certificate, including suspected Covid-19, and are based on the date that deaths occurred. The Department of Health figures are based on when deaths were reported and are for deaths where a person has been tested positive for Covid-19.
