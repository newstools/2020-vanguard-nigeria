According to a report by Ships & Ports, Stakeholders in the water transportation sector had at different fora harped on the need for big companies such as the Dangote Group to embrace the alternative of transporting their products through the waterways instead of hauling them via the roads. The little priority accorded the water transportation system has led to the exertion of too much pressure on the nation’s road networks due to high volumes of vehicular traffic conveying passengers, heavy commodities, goods and services from one part of the country to the other on daily basis. These constant pressures on the roads have given rise to negative consequences such as frequent auto crashes which often lead to loss of lives and property worth millions of naira, nerve-wracking traffic gridlocks and wearing out of our roads, amongst others. All these factors and many others are reasons that should make the government and other critical stakeholders in the transportation sector to see to the development and effective utilization of the waterways. The bulk of the nation’s navigable water channels which link most parts of the country are said to be found within the two main rivers – Niger and Benue. Also, inland water transportation has a lot to contribute to the national economy and development, adding that 28 out of the 36 states of the federation can be accessed through water. One thing is sure, the use and maintenance of navigability of the waterways are safer and much cheaper than the use and maintenance of other modes of transport. Water transport is indeed the most sustainable mode of transportation for the future.
