They said the measure has become imperative in the face of the looming global economic downturn and the low crude oil price brought about by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  In a statement issued in Abuja, the consortium of CSOs also called for the repeal of the Acts establishing the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) and the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF). They also advised the Federal Government to clarify its stance on the Petroleum Support Fund, especially with the elimination of subsidy on petroleum products. The CSOs called on the government to adopt a merit-based model, should it consider an outright sale of the refineries, or in the privatization of the refineries, such as the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) model. They said, “We suggest the adoption of a transparent merit based model for privatization either considering the NLNG for part privatization or an outright sale. We encourage the government to adopt favorable fiscal terms that bring about a renewed investors’ confidence and also help fast track the proposed 29+ refineries, which still have valid operating licenses.” Concerning the PPPRA and PEF, the group emphasized a restructuring of the two downstream agencies in light of recent developments in the international crude oil market and realities in the Nigeria petroleum industry. The Nigeria Natural Resources Charter (NNRC), yesterday, called on the Federal Government to immediately privatise the country's moribund refineries and also sell off its unviable oil assets, so as to be able to cushion the economy from the vagaries of the global economic slowdown occasioned by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)… April 23, 2020 In "News" Before 1973, prices of petroleum products varied from one place to another in Nigeria to the extent of transportation costs incurred in delivering products from the major sources of supply. However, with effect from October 1973, that ceased to be, with the introduction of uniform pricing regime in the country. January 4, 2012 In "Business" The Federal Government has been told to clarify its recent stance and policies on the Nigerian downstream petroleum industry, if it intends to attract increased private sector participation and address the challenges facing the industry.
