A cross-section of the residents, who spoke to journalists, said the road projects in the area will end the economic and social disorder in the community, which grew to alarming proportion as a result of the neglect of the projects over the years. The contractor handling the road project, Tunde Eguaroje, said the project, which is lying next to the University of Benin (UNIBEN) entails construction of a road linking adjoining streets in the area, adding that the road projects are fitted with side drains. He said the project, which started few years ago will be completed soon, noting that asphalt work has been completed on overall 1.5km, while asphalt on the adjoining roads is expected to be completed in weeks. One of the residents, Michael Taylor, said, “We are excited to have benefited from the wake and see governor’s infrastructural project. This project will end the long years of hardship we endured over neglect of the road.” Another resident, Oviasuyi Gabriel, said, “We appreciate the governor for this laudable project. This is the first time we have seen a project from the start to this level. The road project had been abandoned three to four times in the past. Oziegbe Paul said the project will end the long period of hardship residents faced while accessing the area, adding, “Before this time, it was difficult for residents to move easily from Ugbowo down to University of Benin gate through Ekosodin. The progress of work done by the contractors shows that the governor is ready to have the project completed.” The road project in Ekosodin is designed to also bring relief to students and staff of the University of Benin who reside in the area.
