Humbly also, I have been recognized by the World Health Organization and the United Nations. “I humbly submit that I have the cure for Coronavirus (COVID – 19) which is currently ravaging the world. All I ask is for the audience to prove my assertion, and for my assertion to be put to test by the relevant authority (s).” The traditional medicine expert also advised the government to look inwards for the cure of COVID-19 instead of looking outside the country. “In view of the foregoing, I humbly submit that our government does not need to seek for solution for the said COVID – 19 outside our country when we can procure the solution ourselves. “I passionately hope that I will be granted an audience in this regard”, he said. vanguard The House of Representatives yesterday called on the Federal Government to ignore the World Health Organization, WHO, in efforts to find cure for COVID-19 and approve use of alternative remedies to cure the disease.
