Any deal between Fury and AJ, you run it twice. “It’s not a condition of the deal, but it was in their deal with Deontay Wilder and it’s the biggest fight in boxing, so it’s likely you will see that twice. “I had a conversation saying, ‘Wilder is not stepping aside, we will take care of that fight, you take care of the Pulev fight, but let’s get a deal done for 2021’. “We have no problem signing now to fight Fury in 2021.” The Pulev fight, scheduled for June 20 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, has been postponed because of the coronavirus and Hearn still hopes to stage it in the UK, despite offers to go abroad. “The focus remains the same – do the fight in the UK,” the Matchroom MD told Sky Sports. “We have also now conceded that AJ will only fight once this year. “Before it was all about getting that fight in early August to make sure we could fight in December. Because of the preparation needed and the magnitude of his shows, AJ will only box once in 2020.
