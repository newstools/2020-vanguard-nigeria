The items which include 43 various essential food and other items worth N67.5 million and an ambulance worth N15 Million, included: 1,848 cartons of Aquafina water, 105 cartons of sanitizers, 350 cartons of noodles, 100 cartons of 1kg rice, 120 cartons of margarine, 1,000 cartons of Supreme noodles, 1667 cartons of biscuits, 300 cartons of chips, soya oil, 1,000 cartons of semovita and 1,000 cartons of spaghetti among many others. The Consul General of Lebanon, Mr. Elias Nicolas who presented the donation on behalf of the community to the state government commended the state government for the pragmatic and laudable efforts made so far to curtail the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the State. Presenting the items in Ikeja, Nicolas stressed that the Lebanese Community in Lagos considered it necessary to complement as well as support the well-calculated efforts of the state government in the ongoing fight against COVID-19 in the state. According to him, “I thank our Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu and we commend the State’s efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. “We are here accompanied by some prominent members of the Lebanese Community; not just to convey to you a certain donation in kind, but practically to show our brothers and sisters in Nigeria our commitment to the well-being of Nigeria and its people to stand up beside them in this hard moment. “We look forward to a brighter future to reverse all collateral damage of this COVID-19 crisis. We will always be together whether in bad moment or happy one.” Also speaking, Chairman of the Lebanese Community in Lagos, Mr. Faysal El-Khalil, noted that the donation was a token of appreciation for their country of choice, Nigeria, which has accepted them as citizens of the country. El Khalil stated that Nigeria has provided many opportunities to members of the Lebanese community which have helped them build a good and bright future for themselves and grandchildren. “Whatever we are doing today or donating today is nothing but a token of our appreciation for our country of choice Nigeria that has taken us as one of theirs. Nigeria has provided many of us with opportunities that have helped us to build a good and bright future for ourselves and our grandchildren and theirs. “Many of us in the Lebanese community are second, third or even fourth generations. So they are Nigerians indeed and they are proud to be so. What we are doing today is nothing but to say thank you Nigeria, thank you Lagos State,” he said. El-Khalil who assured that the community would always be appreciative of the support and cooperation of Nigeria as a whole, stated, “One of the things that we have recently done is that we have launched an endowment with the American University of Beirut which is one of the best Universities in the Middle East and one of the outstanding Universities in the World whereby every year, a Nigerian will be selected to go and do a MBA Programme at the American University of Beirut, all expenses paid: tuition, boarding, lodgment, food and travel.” Receiving the items on behalf of the State Government, Commissioner for Agriculture, Gbolahan Lawal expressed the profound gratitude of the State Government to the Community for the donation. Lawal explained that the state government has reached out to 440,000 households through its COVID-19 Emergency Food Response Initiative, a palliative for the aged, vulnerable, low-income earners and people living with disabilities. Lawal explained that the pandemic had a negative effect on the financial and economic status of Lagosians which was why the State Government birthed the idea of the Emergency Food Response Initiative to cater to the needs of the aged, vulnerable, people living with disabilities, and daily income earners who might have been directly affected by the lockdown. “The pandemic Corona Virus is novel and it has a lot of negative impact on the economy globally, Lagos inclusive. We as policymakers felt that with the economic lockdown that the pandemic triggered, we decided to come up with food palliatives because we know that over 60% of the population of Lagos constitute the informal sector, whether they’re in the transportation business, artisans or market men and women; those are people that are directly affected by the lockdown because they live on daily wages, if they do not go out in a day, they earn no income,” Lawal noted. While appreciating the generosity of the Lebanese Community, Lawal assured residents, especially those households that are yet to receive stimulus packages that with due diligence, those food items would be distributed to get to those who really need them. “We are honoured that you trust us to distribute these food packs and we promise that we will continue to be accountable and transparent. We appeal to Lagosians who are yet to receive these stimulus packages and we assure them that we will get to you. “It is worthy of note, however, that no matter how much we try, we cannot get to every household because Lagos alone has a population of about 24 million people in over 4 million households. That is why we are lucky to have people like you who have decided to support the initiative of the State Government and a lot of other Lagosians who are doing their bit by feeding the vulnerable in their communities. We say that we see all you do and we are sincerely grateful,” Lawal stated. The commissioner, therefore, appealed to other well-meaning individuals, groups, corporate organisations and associations such as the Lebanese Community to support state government’s efforts on the fight as government can not do it alone, “together, we shall win the war against COVID-19.” Vanguard News Nigeria The Lawmaker representing Isiala Ngwa North State Constituency at the Abia State House of Assembly, Hon Ginger Onwusibe, has donated relief materials and cash worth millions of naira to his constituents as part of his contribution to alleviate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on them as necessitated by the… April 8, 2020 In "News" Commends President Buhari, FCT Minister By Gabriel Ewepu - Abuja The Lebanese community in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja, on Thursday, donated food items worth millions of Naira to the FCT COVID-19 Task Force to ameliorate the sufferings of vulnerable residents as a result of the lockdown and stay-at-home… April 24, 2020 In "News" The Senator representing Imo West senatorial district, Rochas Okorocha, yesterday, handed over thousands of food items as palliatives to twelve local government areas in his senatorial district.
