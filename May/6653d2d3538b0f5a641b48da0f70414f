The preliminary study results, which have yet to be peer-reviewed for publication in a scientific journal, serve as a reminder of the dangers of infection by unidentified carriers of the virus, some of whom show no symptoms, the researchers said. The readings come as Germany took further steps on Monday to ease restrictions, with museums, hairdressers, churches, and more car factories reopening under strict conditions. About 1.8 million people living in Germany must have been infected, more than 10 times the number of about 160,000 confirmed cases so far, the team led by medical researchers Hendrik Streeck and Gunther Hartmann concluded. “The results can help to further improve the models to calculate how the virus spreads. So far the underlying data has been relatively weak,” Hartmann said in a statement. The team analysed blood and nasal swabs from a random sample of 919 people living in a town in the municipality of Heinsberg on the Dutch border, which had among the highest death tolls in Germany. To arrive at their estimate, the researchers put the town’s number of known deaths from COVID-19 relative to the larger estimate of local people with a prior infection – as indicated by antibody blood test readings – and applied the rate of 0.37% to country-wide deaths. They also found that about one in five of those infected showed no symptoms. vanguard As it killed more than 100 in the Chinese province on Monday A map showing just how the coronavirus could have been spread from the epicenter Wuhan has been compiled by researchers as the outbreak is revealed to have killed more 1,000 people the world over, according to data from… February 11, 2020 In "Health" The number of people infected with coronavirus topped 110,000 across the world as the outbreak reached more countries and caused more economic damage.
