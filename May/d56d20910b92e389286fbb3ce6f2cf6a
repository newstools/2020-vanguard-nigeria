They need your support and care while you aware of taking responsibility,” it said. NAN, reports that the NCDC announced the inclusion of Bauchi State Reference Molecular Laboratory, brings the total number of laboratories with the capacity to test for COVID-19 in the country to 29.

The health agency said it had a National testing strategy and that was why it was using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), to scale for the COVID-19. “At the moment, the COVID-19 tests that we report daily are coming from the PCR, they detect the genetic information of the virus, the RNA. That’s only possible if the virus is there and someone is actively infected. “PCR tests are used to directly detect the presence of an antigen, rather than the presence of the body’s immune response, or antibodies. “By detecting viral RNA, which will be present in the body before antibodies form or symptoms of the disease are present, the tests can tell whether or not someone has the virus very early on,” it explained.
