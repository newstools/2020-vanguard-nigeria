The statement did not specify how much of the company’s overall workforce covered and which roles. It said the company is investing funds in safety measures for employees who wish to come to the office “through physical distancing, deep cleaning, temperature checks, and the availability of face coverings and hand sanitizer.” New York Attorney General Letitia James told Amazon last week it may have violated safety measures and labor practices amid the virus outbreak as the company fired a warehouse protest leader in March. Workers at warehouses and other facilities have stayed operational to keep deliveries flowing to customers stuck at home in government-mandated lockdowns. Other employees have been working from home since March. The company has raised overtime pay for warehouse workers and hired 175,000 people last month while rival brick-and-mortar retailers had to shut stores. It had 798,000 full and part-time workers globally as of Dec. 31. vanguard Barely 48 hours before he was redeployed to the ministry of justice as attorney general of the federation, Prince Adetokunbo Kayode spoke to Pension and You on factory accidents, the role of government and measures being taken in the interest of injured employees.
