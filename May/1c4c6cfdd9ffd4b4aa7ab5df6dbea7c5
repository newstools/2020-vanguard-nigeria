The ONS report noted that until April 17, 83.8% of people dying of the coronavirus disease in the UK were of white ethnicity, but black people became the biggest ethnicity group in victims with 6%. According to the British Statistics office, black males in England and Wales are 4.2 times more likely to die if they contract the deadly virus, the risk is 4.3 times more for black women. People with Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian backgrounds, and mixed ethnicities have also a higher risk of death from coronavirus than white people, the ONS suggested. Until April 17, 83.8% of people dying were of white ethnicity, but black people (defined by the study as Black Caribbean, Black African and Black Other) became the biggest ethnicity group in victims with 6%, the statistics office said.
