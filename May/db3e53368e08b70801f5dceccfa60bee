The Anambra State-born beauty had posted a picture of a colleague, Lyna Clems, who is pregnant with the husband on his knees, kissing her naked bum only for the fan to go bare-knuckled. Alex had commented, “You are truly blessed, my friend. Uzoma I am so happy for you. I pray your baby grows into a strong man full of wisdom. Can’t wait to hold, him yessss finally I can post o.” The fan by the username of @rozaygraciasdios, who has since been blocked by the actress unleashed his rage as thus, “ Stay there and be celebrating others, your own na to look for who will sponsor you @onyiialex.” Alex would have none of it as she responded with venom of her own. “ Na God go punish that person wey use your head do blood money. Ewu, Hausa no get sense.” Just some days ago, the actress in an interview revealed a bit of her love life by claiming a fellow actor, Alex Ekubo had been begging her to date him but she had been somewhat uncompromising. “I don’t have any plans to settle down soon. I don’t know. It will happen in God’s time. For now, I am very single. I don’t have a boyfriend.. But Alex Ekubo is begging me to date him…I am still thinking about it though. Alex seems to be really in love with me,” she had stated. Vanguard The average litigant in Nigeria believes you can buy justice.  So, with that frame of mind, it is a very difficult challenge.
