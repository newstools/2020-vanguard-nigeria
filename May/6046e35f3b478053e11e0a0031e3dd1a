The Fed cut its interest rates to near-zero as the pandemic spread and has launched a series of programmes to help businesses and markets continue functioning. More than 36 million U.S. residents have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March when the outbreak caused large segments of the economy to stall. “This is a time of great suffering and difficulty and it’s come on so quickly and with such force that you really can’t put into words the pain people are feeling and the uncertainty they are realising,” Powell said.
