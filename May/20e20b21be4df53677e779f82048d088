While 279 patients have been treated and discharged from isolation centres across the country. Before the easing of the lockdown on May 4, Nigeria had 2558 confirmed infections, 2,071 Active Cases, 400 discharged in the country and 87 deaths. Till date, 3912 cases have been confirmed, 3,116 cases are active, 679 cases have been discharged and 117 deaths have been recorded in 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory. Nigeria has 23,835 samples tested in its ongoing campaign against the deadly COVID-19, which is far less than Ghana and South Africa that have conducted over 100,000 and close to 200,000 testings so far, with South Africa increasing its daily tests to more than 10,000 a day. One of the major mandates in the Act establishing the NCDC is to support all states in preventing, preparing for, detecting and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. While COVID-19 has been unprecedented, NCDC said will not relent in supporting the 36 states of the federation. The agency said that in the last three years, it had supported states in establishing Emergency Operations Centres, rapidly scaled up laboratory capacity and provided other resources for health security at the state level. It added that these resources were now being used for the COVID+19 response in the country. Nigeria’s first case of coronavirus was recorded in February 2020. The Lagos State Ministry of Health revealed in a statement that the case was an Italian citizen who entered Nigeria on the 25th of February from Milan, Italy for a brief business visit. He fell ill on the 26th February and was transferred to Lagos State Biosecurity Facilities for isolation and testing. The patient was later discharged after full recovery and testing negative twice.

The initial outbreak in Wuhan spread rapidly, affecting other parts of China. Cases were soon detected in several other countries. Outbreaks and clusters of the disease have since been observed in Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa and the Americas.
