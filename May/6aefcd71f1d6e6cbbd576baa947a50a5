The prime suspect, Abubakar Sadiq, at the Bauchi Command, during parading of suspects, told Vanguard on Thursday that he and his gang members killed their victim because he recognized some of them. Abubakar Sadiq, a 19-year-old student of medicine and surgery at Alhikma University, said they buried the child by the side of their house for fear that they might be caught. “The child we kidnapped lived in the same area where we live. Our intention was just to use him to get ransom, but things went bad when he saw our faces. So one of us suggested that we kill and bury him. After killing him, we buried him beside our house so that nobody will know. “The Benz you see was bought by one of us (Suleiman Jamilu, one of the kidnappers) with money from the N5 million ransom we got from the doctor. We really didn’t intend to kill the boy, it just happened,” he said. However, the Bauchi Police Command said that the suspects will be charged to court, after parading them at the Command headquarters. According to the Police statement, “On 09/04/2020, one Dr. Sulaiman Auwal ‘m’ of Ibrahim Bako, behind AYM Shafa Filling Station Bauchi, reported that he received a phone call from an unknown person stating that they had kidnapped his son, one Abubakar Sadiq Suleiman ‘m’ 19yrs old and demanded the sum of ten million naira as ransom. “Upon receipt of the report, detectives from the Anti Kidnapping Unit swung into action and arrested the following suspects;
