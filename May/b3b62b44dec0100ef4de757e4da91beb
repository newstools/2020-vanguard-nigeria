Deaths: 221 Meanwhile, as part of efforts to contain and successfully manage COVID-19, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, has validated the first phase of a scientific procedure to extract the RNA of coronavirus. These extraction kits form part of the components of testing through real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction, PCR. Speaking at the validation in Abuja, Director-General of NABDA, Professor Alex Akpa, explained that the success of the validation was important not only to Nigeria but Africa as a whole. “The success of this validation shall enable us to massively produce test kits so that more people would be tested for COVID-19, not only in Nigeria but in Africa. “The immediate aim is to produce reagents for real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction, PCR, and remember, recently the lack of reagents stalled work in Kano and molecular diagnosis could no longer take place,” Akpa said. Also, Dr. Rose Gidado, a scientist at NABDA and Country Coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB), said the validation of  RNAswift Kit for COVID-19 was developed by Dr Alison Nwokeoji, a Nigerian scientist at the University of Sheffield, U.K. The evaluation and validation of the RNAswift Kit for COVID-19 were carried out in the immunology laboratory of the NABDA.
