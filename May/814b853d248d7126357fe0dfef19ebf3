There will be no spectators, no handshakes, restrictions on players talking to team-mates, opponents and officials, and coaches having to wear face masks. “Excessive spitting or blowing of the nose is prohibited and players should refrain from close conversations,” said K-League communication officer Woo Cheoung-sik. “During the game, players who habitually spit or talk closely will be warned.” Australia international Adam Taggart, who was the K-League’s top scorer last season with 20 goals, is unsure how those new rules will be policed. “We are still waiting to get a full explanation on that,” Bluewings striker Taggart told BBC World Service Sport. “The talking part, if that is correct, is going to be a tough one. You can just imagine there will be red cards left, right and centre if people are going to get punished for talking.” Jeonbuk Motors – who have been champions for the past three seasons – face Suwon Bluewings in the opening game.
