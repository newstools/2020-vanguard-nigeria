This is a similar rate of increase as the day before despite health authorities having resumed taking into account nursing home data after a four-day interruption. In a statement, the Health Ministry said the number of fatalities was up 83 in hospitals, to 18,195. But the death toll in nursing homes has been revised to 10,335, 10 fewer than the last time it was published. (Reuters/NAN) Vanguard News Nigeria
