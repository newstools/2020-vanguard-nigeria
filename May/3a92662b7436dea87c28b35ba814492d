The 2019/2020 campaign was brought to a screeching halt back in March due to the COVID-19 outbreak, while ‘Project Restart’ has been ramped up in recent days with clubs approving a return to full contact training on Wednesday. Throughout the crisis, Premier League sides has kept in dialogue and at their most recent meeting on Thursday a consensus over the exact return date of top flight English football appears to have been reached. As reported by the Telegraph, action will resume on 17 June with City vs Arsenal the headline act.

Concerns have previously been raised over the possibility of fans congregating outside empty stadiums – breaking social distancing protocol in the process. The mayor of Liverpool caused controversy when he suggested that Reds supporters would be likely to do this if Jurgen Klopp’s side secured the club’s maiden Premier League title. Despite these concerns, the police are content for the vast majority matches to be played at their original venues with only ‘high-profile’ games being considered for neutral venues. The Bundesliga – which returned earlier this month – have experienced no such issues with fans respecting social distancing regulations and staying away from stadiums.
