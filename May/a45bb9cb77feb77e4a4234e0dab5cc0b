How? Since January 2020, the Boko Haram insurgency, murderous activities of bandits, kidnappers, herdsmen and sectarian violence have claimed no fewer than 2,771 lives in Nigeria, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR, a US-based think tank, under its Nigeria Security Tracker, NST, programme.  A breakdown of the deaths showed that 320 people were killed in January. In February, 597 Nigerians were killed. In March, the figure was 754; April had 625 and as of May 15, 2020 no fewer than 475 people had been slaughtered. Also, cumulatively, no fewer than 385,629 lives have been lost this year to malaria, pregnancy-related complications and poor care for children under five years old. Nigeria accounts for 20 to 23 per cent of global deaths from maternal mortality (women who die due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth). The World Health Organisation, WHO, puts the figure at 20 per cent while the Lead Consultant of the National Safety Data, MSD, Mary-Ann Etiebet, said it is 23 per cent. This means that of the 120,300 women who died from pregnancy and childbirth complications between January and May 21, 2020, according to Worldometer, Nigeria accounted for 24,060 to 27,669 of the deaths. The WHO, in its 2019 Malaria Report said that the world’s largest black nation contributes 25 per cent of global malaria cases and 24 per cent of deaths. This indicates that as of May 21, 2020, Nigeria had lost 91,560 people to malaria. At press time, Worldometer real-time statistics showed that 381,500 people had died from malaria in 2020. Meantime, Nigeria is a major contributor to deaths of children under five years. According to the UNICEF, Nigeria accounts for nine per cent of global child mortality. Worldometer records at press time showed that 2.96 million children under-five years had died in 2020. In essence, 266,400 of the dead children were Nigerians. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease in Nigeria, late February, the various governments took various measures to combat the plague. It started with lock-down of Lagos State, the epicentre of the disease in Nigeria, Ogun State and Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, FCT for two weeks. The lock-down was further extended by two weeks. Now, the lock-down has been eased but there is restriction of inter-state movement across the country and curfew from 8pm to 6am. Some other states have adopted various restrictive measures. While much energy is channeled towards fighting the Coronavirus disease, other health needs of the citizenry are neglected. Citizens lament Mr. Hilary Okoro has been in serious pains in the last three months. He is due for hip operation but doctors told him nothing can be done until after the lock-down and when normalcy returns. ‘’I am in serious pains but I have handed everything over to God. The doctor asked me to do some tests, which I have done but he said they cannot carry out the operation now until after the lock-down.’’ Also, Mrs Tessy Ndubuisi, who was pregnant with her second baby and advised to have CS, had to be taken to three hospitals within a period of seven days before she was delivered of a baby girl, last Tuesday. She did not face such challenge when she had her first baby through CS, two years ago.
Given the challenges the governments are facing over COVID-19, there is little or no hope of things improving soon. On Wednesday, Lagos State Government said COVID-19 patients whose cases are not serious would not be admitted at isolation centres. It said patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms would be treated at home. ‘’We will be concentrating on people with severe cases and isolating them while mild cases will be managed at home. Our attention is shifting to community-based isolation,’’ Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, said. If mild COVID-19 patients will be treated at home the fate of people suffering from other diseases is left to imagination. Since Nigeria recorded her first case of COVID-19 late February, 7016 persons, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, have tested positive for the disease. Of this number, 1,907 people were successfully treated and discharged while 211 people died as of Thursday night. How 2771 Nigerians were killed in five months FEBRUARY
