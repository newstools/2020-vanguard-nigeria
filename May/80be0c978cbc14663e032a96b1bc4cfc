In total, different trials were ongoing in Egypt, Zambia, Nigeria, Tunisia and South Africa. The Africa CDC admitted that comparatively few treatments were taking place on the continent. The Africa CDC’s disclosures were held in a virtual meeting with doctors at Shanghai hospital. They wrote about the Webinar for Clinical Care: “This is the Africa CDC Institute for Workforce Development (IWD) Clinical Community of Practice weekly webinar to build emergency COVID-19 capacity — a virtual community of practice, bringing doctors and clinical providers together over the internet to learn as a community about how best to diagnose, manage, and treat patients with COVID-19.”

Scientists there are also conducting around two trials on vaccines. They are also looking at the place of nutritional support, especially with honey and some immunotherapy trials are going on in Egypt. Zambia: Has one trial ongoing with hydroxychloroquine – the anti-malarial drug touted as a potent remedy. South Africa: Africa’s most tested country is also part of the WHO solidarity trial, which is also looking at the efficacy of Chloroquine, Interferon, Remdesivir. Nigeria: Like in the cases of Egypt has a trial in progress – still on therapeutic agents. Tunisa: Two trials ongoing.
