Speaking about Mount, Messi said (via the Daily Mirror): “Having watched him play he has the potential to be one of the best.” Former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill was also recently full of praise for Mount after his breakthrough season. “I like the look of Mason Mount,” Cahill told Sky Sports. “I think he’s a top goalscorer and he’s got a massive career ahead of him. “One of the reasons why I like him a lot is because of his coach [Frank Lampard] and the way that he’s trying to mould a player similar to himself. “He can lead him and show him the right ways. “You can see that starting to come to fruition with his football this season.
