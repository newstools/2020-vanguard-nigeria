Giving the charge during the inauguration ceremony of NOUN Oracle Academy organised by the Department of Computer Science, NOUN, on Tuesday, May 12, 2020, Adamu said: “Any lecturer in the National Open University of Nigeria who failed to interact with their students via online facilitation should either look for a College of Education to go and teach or resign and start selling foodstuff in the market.” Adamu, who made the statement in answer to a student who, during the question and answer session of the virtual inauguration ceremony, queried why all lecturers were not interfacing with their students regularly in online facilitation, said that no NOUN lecturer had any excuse whatsoever not to have online interaction with their students on a regular basis. The vice-chancellor said that the university has put all facilities and structures in place to enable its academic staff to interface with their students via online facilitation regularly.

He added that the university would put necessary machinery in motion to monitor and ensure that all academic staff of the university maintain regular interaction with their students during this Covid-19 lockdown and beyond. He warned that erring lecturers would be sanctioned accordingly. vanguard IF students who enrolled for the law programme at the National Open University of Nigeria, NOUN, had known that upon graduation from the institution they would not be allowed to attend the Nigerian Law School, they would not have opted for the law programme of the institution.
