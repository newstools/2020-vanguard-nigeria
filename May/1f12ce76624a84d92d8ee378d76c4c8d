Mavin Records star artist, Rema, recently sent out a strong warning to haters who feel they can stop him with theirs insults; he wants them to know that he can’t be stopped, no matter what they do. In a question and answer session with his fans on Instagram, the ‘Dumebi’ crooner, poured out his mind on issues bordering on how stars get treated in Nigeria.
