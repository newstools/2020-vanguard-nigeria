The advice is coming from the Chief Executive Officer of SMO food and fruit, MR Shuaib Mubarak, who says agriculture offers full economic potential if harnessed and given needed priority. In a statement made available to vanguard, the Chief Executive officer of SMO foods and fruit Nigeria Ltd, Mr Shuiab Mubarak told journalists that “Agriculture has never been affected by any pandemic, outbreak or any economic downturn.
According to him, “The coronavirus outbreak has made farming and another agro sector now growing more than ever before and the need for food is increasing daily.

pawpaw fruit in 3 months after planting and harvest is 6 month. “Pawpaw has 100-300 fruit on a stand, and harvest is 5- 10 daily. Pawpaw fruit is sold for N100- N300 from the farm, this depends on the size of the fruit.” “With N100 x 5 fruit is N500 daily on a tree, and 150 stands on a plot that is 500x 150= 75,000 daily, when removing other expensive you end with 50,000 daily on a plot.” “Market prices of other fruit you can harvest include:  palm oil- N10000 per keg, Coconut N500 per fruit, Cashew N400,000 per tonne, lemon N1000 per fruit and lot more which are sold every day in our local and international markets.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1388011 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="Shuaib Mubarak " width="640" height="640" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?w=911&amp;ssl=1 911w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?resize=194%2C194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shuaib-Mubarak.jpg?resize=130%2C130&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> On the health benefits from Agro produce, Mr Shuaib Mubarak notes that the immune system can be boosted when we eat foods made from natural ingredients.
