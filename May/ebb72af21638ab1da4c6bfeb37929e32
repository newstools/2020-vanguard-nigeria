These particular groups of Nigerians is called “ALMAJIRIs” in the Northern part of Nigeria.  They are mostly destitute and are without a doubt, very vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection. “Their massive influx into other states, particularly in southwest coinciding with the spread of COVID-19 constitutes a great threat in many respects and calls for concern. “Government has set up an effective and already running system of containment which returns the ALMAJIRIs to their states of origin. “My message to you at this time is to remain vigilant and be conscious of happenings in your environment. The governor said “You are enjoined to report cases of such importation of Almajiris to appropriate authorities to help us effectively curtail community transmission of COVID-19 in our state. Akeredolu also pointed out that his administration would not hesitate to ” direct the commencement of mobile courts for instant trial of individuals who fail to comply with our COVID-19 orders and regulations.
