Former President Goodluck Jonathan, has given reason he is stepping away from active politics in the country. Disclosing this on Sunday in Yenagoa, when Governor Douye Diri inaugurated the state executive council of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Jonathan said: “Don’t be discouraged if you do not see me in most party activities in the state. I decided to appear in this event so that I will not be misunderstood. “I’m shifting away from being an effective partisan politician because of my foundation.

Through that process, I would be able to support the nation and the state in one way or the other.” Vanguard Dr.Tony Akabuno is the Delta State coordinator for Neighbour 2 Neighbour,the volunteer group that together with the Goodluck/Sambo campaign Organisation toured the nooks and crannies of the country spreading the transformation message of Dr. Goodluck Jonathan June 1, 2011 In "Features" As President Jonathan took the about 40yard walk from the VIP Box, to the blaring sound of music rendered by DBanj,he attempted yahooze dance steps to the rhythm as provided.
