The violators who were arrested at Kubwa and Dutse Alhaji Districts of the FCT are to be arraigned before the Mobile Court. Some of those arrested were in drinking bars and gardens, while a tricycle operator and a commercial motorcyclist were arrested for operating during the curfew hours. At Second Gate, Dutse-Alhaji, the team accosted the operator of a drinking bar who claimed to be a soldier but upon interrogation, he admitted that he lied in order to evade arrest. He disclosed that he is a Chef who closes late from work and not military personnel as claimed. At Dutse Makaranta, the team shut a beer parlour which was fully in operation a few minutes after 10 pm. The manager of the place also claimed that it is owned by a serving Major in the Nigerian Army, saying they decided to operate into the curfew hours because of the occupation of the owner. Addressing journalists after the night operation, Chairman of the Task Team, Ikharo Attah, however, noted that the compliance level in Kubwa and Dutse area is very high. “Unlike Lugbe where we went a few days ago, most of the known nightclubs and bars in Kubwa and Dutse-Alhaji are closed. Vehicular movement is very few and made up largely of those on the exemption list”, he stated. Attah decried “the level at which some residents of Dutse Alhaji and Makaranta parade themselves as military personnel even when they are not”. He said; “The Chef claimed to be a soldier while the beer parlour Manager said the place belongs to a Major in the Army. This must stop forthwith. People should not drag the name and image of the military in the mud.” The Task team Chairman also lamented that; “Despite the high level of compliance in these areas, very few persons still seem not to fully understand the purpose of the curfew. Imagine the lady we met who claimed she was going to visit her friend after 9 pm during the curfew. Also surprising this night were the two bricklayers we caught who were returned from Bauchi state despite the interstate travel ban and were going home to Bwari town. We still keep appealing to other Enforcement officers across the country to close ranks and halt the interstate travelling which seems to be going on massively despite the Presidential ban.” Vanguard ABUJA: Operators of a nightclub and lounge in the Lugbe area of the nation's capital, Abuja got the shock of their lives at the weekend as they were arrested by the Federal Capital Territory Ministerial Enforcement Task team for operating despite directives that all such businesses and recreational parks be… May 24, 2020 In "News" By Omeiza Ajayi ABUJA: The enforcement of the restriction orders in the Federal Capital Territory FCT turned dramatic on Sunday when the Pastor in Charge of Shekinah Glory Church, Jabi, along with some of his Deacons and workers scaled the fence to evade arrest on sighting the Ministerial Enforcement Team… May 4, 2020 In "News" The Joint Operation Task -Team for the Enforcement of Federal Government’s lockdown order said it had impounded 51 cars, nine tricycles and 46 motorcycles in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
