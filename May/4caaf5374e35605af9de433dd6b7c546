In a condolence message, Prof. Fagbohun expressed his sympathy at the death of Justice Oluwa thus: “On behalf of the entire Lagos State University Community, my self inclusive , I convey our deepest sympathy at the death of Justice Isiaka Ishola Oluwa, who served as the second Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of our dear university between 1988 and 1990. During this period, his leadership and character served the fledging university well and contributed immensely to the success story it has now become as the foremost university in the country. His profound impact on other notable positions that he held within and outside Lagos State, during his lifetime will also remain indelible for a long time to come.” The vice chancellor ended with a prayer for the departed and his family: “His death is indeed a painful one, but we can do nothing but yield to the will of Almighty Allah. May the Almighty Allah accept his gentle soul and grant his family the fortitude to bear the huge loss.” The Lagos State University (LASU) on Monday rationalised the dismissal of the institution’s Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), his deputy and 13 other staff members, saying it was not politically motivated.
