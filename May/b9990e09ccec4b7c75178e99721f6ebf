It was a kiss to make angels faint and demons weep…a passionate, demanding, soul-searing kiss that nearly knocked the earth off its axis. A Birthday Kiss from me to you my Love. It’s your birthday baby. Every second of today belongs to you and have I told you today that I love you beyond words. Well, I just did @Officiallrosie. The birthday girl took it in with delight and couldn’t hold her own emotions at bay as they broke out in outpouring expression of love. She writes: When others saw the dirt in me you saw the gold in me. Thank you for standing tall with me and taking my hand to walk with me till eternity @iam_kachiucheagwu.
