Ushie commended the media for its patience adding that they understand the terrain of the state which makes collation of result from hard to reach areas very difficult. The local governments include, Abi, Biase, Yala, Ogoja, Calabar -South, Calabar Municipal, Boki, Obudu, Bekwarra, Bakassi, Yakurr, Obanliku, Odukpani, Obubra, Etung, Ikom, Akpabuyo and Akamkpa.
