Senator Gyang is, therefore, crying out that the lives of his people is at risk as communities are left at the mercy of killer herdsmen and bandits. “Consequently, Senator Gyang is calling on the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Plateau State Governor, Commander Operation Safe Haven and the Commissioner of Police who have the constitutional responsibility of safeguarding the lives and property of citizens to take decisive steps to enforce law and order and end the killings in Irigwe Chiefdom in particular and Plateau North at large. “Government must not allow merchants of unrest and bloodshed to continue disrupting the peace which the people of Plateau North have resolved to build and consolidate.” Vanguard News Nigeria.
