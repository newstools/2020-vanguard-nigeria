The FA had previously indicated their intention to appeal after being fined as part of the ruling which also saw Chelsea punished for breaches of rules relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18. The case is now listed on the CAS scheduled to be heard on June 26. In February 2019, Chelsea were handed a transfer ban for two windows and fined, although both punishments were later reduced on appeal with the club permitted to sign players again this January. The FA was initially fined 510,000 Swiss francs (£391,000 at the time), reduced to 350,000 Swiss francs on appeal. The governing body was also given six months “to address the situation concerning the international transfer and first registration of minors in football”. However, the FA responded by saying it would appeal and would “continue to work with FIFA and Chelsea in a constructive manager to address the issues which were raised by this case.” Football 365 Vanguard Chelsea have appealed against the one-year transfer ban handed to the Premier League giants, FIFA confirmed on Tuesday, but will have to wait to discover whether the ban will be temporarily lifted pending the outcome of the appeal.
