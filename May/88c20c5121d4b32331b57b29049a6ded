The lawmaker who was found guilty of financial impropriety while serving as governor of Abia state and was subsequently sent to jail last year, however, regained freedom, albeit temporary, when the apex court, presided over by Justice Ejembi Eko nullified his conviction yesterday. The former Abia state governor was on December 5th, 2019 found guilty of misappropriating the state’s funds up to the tune of N7.6 billion and was reminded at Kuje Prison, Abuja. However, Justice Eko declared his conviction null and void and ordered his retrial.

I think Nigerians should wait for the process to be exhausted. That’s all the PDP can say for now,” Ologbondiyan said.
