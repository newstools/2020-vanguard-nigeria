The Portuguese coach had an extremely successful two seasons in charge of Inter, winning two Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia and a Champions League. However, current Tottenham boss Mourinho admits he made some mistakes during his tenure at the San Siro and there were times where he acted like “a d*ckhead”. “There are relationships: I coach, you play. Empathy depends on the ability to accept me as I am – it’s like a puzzle,” Mourinho told Gazzetta Dello Sport. “At Inter, there were people waiting for someone like me to complete that puzzle. I’m never fake, I’m original: it’s me and that’s it. I was also a d*ckhead, but that was me.” When asked to elaborate, Mourinho used a 3-1 loss in January 2009 as an example, he added: “Especially after the defeat against Bergamo. I was very violent with the players – I told them they had won the Scudetto of sh*t. It was only afterwards that I understood I had hurt them and I apologised.” Mourinho continued: “I was at my best when I felt at home, where I could feel the emotions of the group, where I was 200 per cent invested with my heart. That’s why, on May 22 in Madrid, I was content to experience the happiness of others, all the way from [president Massimo] Moratti to the people working in the warehouse. “I had already won a Champions League title – I used to always think of myself first and then others. At Inter, it was never like that. “In a family, when you become a father, you understand that someone is more important than you and that you move into second place. “Ten years later, we are all together again. Just the other day I spoke to Alessio, my driver from my time at Inter. Where and when does it happen that a coach who leaves, ten years later still talks to the driver? Never. That’s Inter for me. These are my people.” Football 365 Vanguard Jose Mourinho launched a stinging attack on Dutchman Frank de Boer on Monday after the former Crystal Palace coach criticised Manchester United's sparse use of Marcus Rashford.

His contribution to football has been huge, not only for the titles, but also for the way of playing and his quality as a person.
