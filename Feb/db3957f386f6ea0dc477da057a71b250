Now I can leave the stadium with a huge smile on my face. “The fans had prepared this huge choreography that took up the entire end of the stadium. You don’t get that atmosphere in the Premier League, partly because they’re not allowed to. “Here, you really feel the fans pushing you on from the moment you arrive in the team bus. They are slapping their hands on the side of the vehicle, you feel their passion and understand how important this match is.” With his exit from Tottenham taking so long and form dipping in north London this season, Eriksen was often made a scapegoat by those in the stands. In Milan, however, the 27-year-old is feeling far more loved. Eriksen said: “I really feel that many fans are happy I am here. That fires me up, it motivates me, it pushes me in the right direction and helps me to settle in. So far, everything has gone really well.” Vanguard News Zlatan Ibrahimovic's return to AC Milan will add spice to the city derby against Inter Milan on Sunday with the Swede looking to thwart Antonio Conte's side from keeping pace with Serie A leaders Juventus.
