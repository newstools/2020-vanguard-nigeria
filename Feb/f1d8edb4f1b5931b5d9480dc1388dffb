SEVEN Months into the inauguration of the 9th Senate, Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo Agege, All Progressives Congress, APC, Delta Central Presided over Plenary for the first time on Thursday. Omo- Agege rose to occupy the seat during plenary at 11.30am after the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan sought to leave the chamber to allow him attend to other national issues outside the National Assembly.
