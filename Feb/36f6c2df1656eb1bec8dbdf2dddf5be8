The Tesla and SpaceX head tweeting earlier this week, “All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla.” Musk was, according to TechCrunch, “responding to a new MIT Technology Review profile of OpenAI, an organization founded in 2015 by Musk, along with Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman. … At the time of its founding in 2015, Musk posited that the group essentially arrived at the idea for OpenAI as an alternative to ‘sit[ting] on the sidelines’ or ‘encourag[ing] regulatory oversight’.” Since 2015, Musk has distanced himself from OpenAI and openly criticized it.
