The tragic crash involved two J5 buses and 36 people. Spokesperson of the Federal Road Safety Commission, FRSC, in the state, Abubakar Usman, said 11 people were injured in the crash, while three others escaped unhurt. Both vehicles burst into flames after the crash and all 22 persons, who lost their lives, were burnt to death. A witness, Shafi’u Suleiman, said those involved in the crash included a bride, her friends and some married women and children, who were escorting her to her marital home. According to the witness, the bride and one of the drivers were among the survivors. This has, however, not been confirmed by the FRSC officials, who are still working out the full details and identities of those involved.
