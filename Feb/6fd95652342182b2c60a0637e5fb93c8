Speaking during a recognition award in Bauchi on Friday, the Executive Chairman of the agency, Dr. Rilwanu Mohammed said that the laboratory when established will be responsible for the diagnosis of diseases such as Lassa fever, Yellow fever, measles, and other hemorrhagic fevers. “Because of the frequent disease outbreak in this region, we need a medical laboratory that will serve as a reference point for the Northeast. We are currently planning and discussing with the teaching hospital in the state in that regard. We want to start with a small one with the hope that in the near future, a bigger centre will be built for the Northeast. This will enable us to carry out our test here rather than taking it to Abuja or another axis. It will also serve as a reference point for the Northeast region. “By our analysis, the laboratory will generate between 150 to 200 million naira annually for the government. The Primary Health Care Development Agency wants to start doing something that will support the government of Bauchi state,” he said. Also speaking at the occasion, the Deputy governor, Baba Tela who also doubles as Chairman, Task Force Committee on Primary Healthcare, charged stakeholders in the health sector to put more effort into implementing various programmes for improved healthcare delivery in the state. vanguard The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, yesterday announced the laboratory confirmation of 15 cases of yellow fever from the 169 clinically suspected cases recorded in Bauchi between August 29th and 11th of September, 2019.
