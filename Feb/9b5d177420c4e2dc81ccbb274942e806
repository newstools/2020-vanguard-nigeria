Talking about promises, it looks like the Gypsy King knows how to keep them all. He promised to sing a song after his victory, he did that in style as the crowd sang along the American Pie with him. His brilliant speech, thanking Jesus and dedicating the victory to him is rare in that fashion; leaving your opponents with a bloodied face and thanking Jesus? (Devil must be in real big trouble). There was even enough time to reserve praises for his prey, “Wilder will be champions again…” there was even more time to enjoy his own victory. “…But the King is back,” he said. The reactions from social media tell it all.  Tyson Fury licked blood off Wilder, praised Jesus Christ and is now singing American Pie. My mind is legitimately blown rn. This is spectacular. This guy is a superstar. pic.twitter.com/Slr1L8gpoK — Trend Amplifier || Trouble Maker (@queeninghere) February 23, 2020  Eddie Hearn and Antony Joshua after seeing Tyson Fury demolish Wilder…#WilderFury #TysonFury pic.twitter.com/FKfZIQKUjf — Kev (@Kev_ritchard) February 23, 2020  “[Deontay Wilder] will be a champion again, but I will say the king has returned to the top of the throne.” —Tyson Fury  #WilderFury2 pic.twitter.com/Qkprct9QwG — shezi_media (@Shezi49814476) February 23, 2020  Tyson Fury destroyed Wilder and then had the whole arena singing American Pie Skull damn wilder the man whoop and ass and sing a song #WildervsFury2 pic.twitter.com/z7CeWFKIh9 — Jishan (@iamsrkJishan_) February 23, 2020  Deontay Wilder had the best knockout percentage in heavyweight history.
