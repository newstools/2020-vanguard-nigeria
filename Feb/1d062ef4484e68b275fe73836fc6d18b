Excavating contractor JR’s Demolition demolished the home, locally known as the “pink house,” in the Victory Place neighborhood Wednesday, KTVT reported. It wasn’t until after the job was done that they learned they had the wrong home. The “pink house,” on Richard Avenue, is owned by former Dallas resident Jeremy Wenninger, who is now living in California, the outlet reported. He told the station he got a call that a bulldozer was on the property and the home was being razed. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1347757" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1" alt="Texas, Demolition" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=58%2C39&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=260%2C173&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=195%2C130&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=115%2C77&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?resize=560%2C373&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/texas-house-demo-01.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> A good friend of Wenninger used to live there, and left the property to him after her death three years ago, he said. Though he no longer lived in the area, he was in the process of renovating the property, he added. JR’s Demolition owner Bobby Lindamood told the outlet that this was the first time the company ever tore down the wrong structure. “We made a mistake and thought we had the right property,” Lindamood said. “Many homes on Richard Street have been demolished by JR’s and other demolition companies in connection with the current redevelopment and revitalization of this area.” “Unfortunately, this home did not have any house numbers on it and any street curb address was covered by water and debris from the recent heavy rain events,” he added. “Nonetheless, JR’s inspected this property ensuring that it was empty.” Workers nearby told the company the property had vagrants and has been vacant since October, according to Lindamood. It was also “similar in appearance and condition to many of the properties that JR’s demolished on Richard Street,” the owner said. “We spoke with the new owner of the property who acquired it in 2019 and will be working with him toward a resolution,” Lindamood added. Wenninger said he hopes the resolution will honor the sentimental value of the 97-year-old Craftsman-style home.
