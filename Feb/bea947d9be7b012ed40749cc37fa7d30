Son suffered the injury in the first-minute challenge with Villa’s Ezri Konsa and though he completed the 90 minutes and scored twice, he now faces surgery on the injury and a potential long-term lay-off. The injury leaves Tottenham desperately short up front, with first-choice striker Harry Kane also a long-term absentee with a hamstring injury. Son has been deputising as the main frontman since Kane’s injury but with both players now missing, Lucas Moura or untested youngster Troy Parrott may be required to step in. But Mourinho said last month that Parrott is “not ready at all” to fill the void as the main striker, though the Republic of Ireland Under-21 international could be considered for some playing time. In his pre-match press conference for Wednesday’s Champions League clash with RB Leipzig, Mourinho said of Son: “We are going to miss him. “The club wrote a nice statement. If I was the one to write the statement I would write different. We miss him. “The situation couldn’t be worse. That is obvious. There is nothing we can do. “We are going to play with the players we have available. I was worried about not having attacking options on the bench now I don’t have attacking options on the pitch.” Asked if he would have to try a different style of play with Son now absent as well as Kane, Mourinho replied: “Yes, it has to be. “You know that I like analogies, and sometimes I do good ones and sometimes I do silly ones I think in this case, I’ll try to do one for you. “When we arrived we were on the minus-12th floor, we got on the stairs and we started climbing. But immediately in the beginning, the stairs broke so we were in trouble and we were finding a way to try to get up. “We found a way, with a lot of work and a lot of effort and we started going and going and going, and when we arrive on the fourth floor, which was where we wanted to arrive, somebody came and took the stairs away. “So now we are in trouble. Now we have two options. “One is to give up and we will fall and normally die because it’s the fourth floor. Another way is to fight with what we have, no stairs but arms. So, we’re going to be on that balcony fighting with everything that we have.” Football 365 Vanguard News Korean star Son Heung-min's season could well be over said Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho on Tuesday after the club said the player had fractured his right arm.
