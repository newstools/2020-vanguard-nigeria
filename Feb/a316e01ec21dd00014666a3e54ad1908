China confirmed 2,015 new cases of the deadly virus, the lowest daily increase since Jan. 30 as the total rose to 44,653. The report eased financial market concerns about the potential impact on both the Chinese and global economies. The dollar hit a fresh four-month high even as Dale Fisher, a global expert associated with the World Health Organization, warned the toll was just beginning elsewhere. Copper climbed on the belief that China, the world’s biggest metals consumer, faces a short but sharper economic shock than originally thought. But how harsh the impact will vary widely. Markets are clearly encouraged by the moderating trajectory of new and suspected cases of the virus, as well as the continued support of Federal Reserve monetary policy, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. Renewed enthusiasm among investors also is being driven by the resumption of earnings growth and a global economic recovery that was becoming evident before the coronavirus outbreak, Joy said. However, investor enthusiasm may be tested once economic data from late January and February begins to roll in, he said. “By a number of measures, valuations are quite extended, making this rally something of a leap of faith,” Joy said. I would not argue with anyone wishing to bank some of their profits.” Stock indexes around the world again hit new highs, including the three major Wall Street gauges, MSCI’s world index, the pan-European STOXX 600, Germany’s DAX, the S&P/TSX in Canada and the S&P/NZX 50 in New Zealand.
