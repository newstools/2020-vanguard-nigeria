It said the move was to ensure that the 95 confirmed cases of Lassa fever in some states across the country within the week were effectively managed. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director-General of NCDC, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Saturday in Abuja that the 95 established cases were the highest number of confirmed cases in a single week. “This reporting week, NCDC managed a record number of 95 cases. This was possible through collaborative efforts across states with coordination from us,” he said. Ihekweazu said that as of Jan. 26, a total of   258 confirmed cases and 41 deaths were reported from 19 states since the beginning of the year. According to him, of the confirmed new cases, 89 are from three states of Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi with 38  per cent each from Edo and Ondo, and Ebonyi having 11 per cent. He said that NCDC had continued to support states in responding to the outbreak including the deployment of Rapid Response Teams to support affected states. “The NCDC, through its National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Gaduwa, collaborates with 37 laboratories divided into five laboratory networks for the diagnosis of epidemic-prone diseases across Nigeria. “Currently there are five Lassa fever laboratories in this network. Three of these laboratories are situated in states where we recorded the highest number of cases- Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi. “Despite the increase in the number of cases, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) for 2020 is lower at 15.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2019 which was 19.7 percent,” he stated. The NCDC boss attributes the seasonal rise in Lassa fever cases to ecological factors and the presence of rats in the environment which could transmit the virus. According to him, this is also the case for other African countries with similar context. “Lassa fever is largely transmitted through contact with items or surfaces contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. “It can also be transmitted from person-to-person through contact with blood, urine, feces and other body fluids of an infected person. “To minimise the risk of infection, members of the public are advised to ensure their environment is always kept clean to avoid contact with rodents,” he said. Ihekweazu advised health workers to continue to maintain a high index of suspicion of the disease as Lassa fever could present just like malaria and similar illnesses. “It is very important that health care workers maintain standard care precautions when managing patients. “Early symptoms are fever, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, sore throat. “It is in very severe cases that the patient bleeds from body openings. “If a patient does not respond to treatment for malaria or other febrile illnesses after 48 hours, it is important to test immediately for Lassa fever,” the disease expert said. vanguard THE Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control, NCDC, has confirmed 16 deaths from 60 cases of Lassa fever even as 590 out of 593 contacts are currently under watch in eight States of the Federation since the beginning of the year.
