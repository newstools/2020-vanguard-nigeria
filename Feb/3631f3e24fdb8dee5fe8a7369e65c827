However, in this chat, he spoke on Abia politics, why the legislature enjoys harmonious relations with the executive, why he will not contest 2023 governorship election and why the House is doing its best to partner Governor Okezie Ikpeazu in his quest to develop Abia State. What you should ask them is what would be the impeachable offence? If you want to impeach somebody, the person must have committed an impeachable offence. Can those people tell me what the impeachable offence is? Is the Governor of the state not doing his job? That is why I am happy with the governor, a lot of insinuations have been made and many things said to cause problems between him and me, but he has resisted them because he knows my mind. He knows I mean well for him. I don’t blame those that started this propaganda. They started it because they do not know the depth of the relationship that exists between the governor and I, otherwise, they would not waste their time talking about impeachment all the time. Let me ask you, so I have now become so powerful that the governor does not have his people in the Assembly representing him? He doesn’t have any other person in the House such that I will just come to the House and rail-road an impeachment process in the House, not minding other colleagues, the principal officers and Leader of the House who is a brother of the governor? How can I achieve that? I don’t know how our people think. I suggest that they try to find other areas of propaganda to feast on and not on this area because I don’t have any history of betrayal since I started my political career. I do not have any history of betraying anybody who trusts me. As far as I am concerned, going by what the Governor has passed through, it is by divine intervention and providence that he is the governor of the state because attempts have been made to ensure he didn’t become governor and at the end of the day, he emerged victoriously. The governor has been doing his job very well. He performs his functions as the governor of the state and I do not know the excuse that anybody will wake up tomorrow to say he wants to impeach him. That propaganda was started by those that view me as their enemy. It was started by those that feel that I am a stumbling block to their peace and happiness of becoming governor without actually working for it. It is morally wrong for me to aspire to become governor of this state for now. Why do I say that? My dear father left office in 2015 as governor. In 2023, it would have been eight years since he left office. The question I want to ask these propagandists is this, is there no other qualified Abian that I should become governor? If they know how my father plays politics, they will not waste their time propagating falsehood. To me, it can be summed up very simply that Chinedum Enyinnaya Orji whether Speaker or not, it is morally wrong for me to aspire to be governor of Abia in 2023 or even 2027 for the simple reason that my father, the immediate past governor just left office. We have not reached the level of the American mentality in politics. If I want to contest the election, the signs would be on the ground and not mere insinuations. My simple advice to those that are afraid of Chinedum Orji with respect to the issue of the speakership, is that they should hit the ground running, they should go to the field, channel the resources they are wasting on this propaganda on the youths, women and critical stakeholders on the need to elect them. They should stop this fear of the unknown. I am not their problem. They are their own problem because they have started badly by using propaganda instead of empowerment. The relationship between the House and the Governor is a very cordial one. People have tried as much as they can to incite trouble into that relationship but as far as I am concerned, the Governor remains the Governor of the state and a very good friend that lays emphasis on mutual respect. In effect, the relationship between the legislature and the executive is harmonious. The reason was basically to contribute my quota to the development of the state; correct some negative impressions about my person and at the same time, use the instrumentality of the legislature to help my friend, the Governor. Before now, a certain impression was heaped around me because I am a very private person, and I hardly say much to the media. In 2015, I contested election just to be a member of the assembly but the insinuation then was that I wanted to become speaker. At the end of the day, I did not become a speaker from 2015 to 2019. As the Majority Leader then, I never moved any motion to remove this same governor they are accusing me of trying to betray. If I didn’t betray the governor as majority leader in the House, what moral justification do I have now to betray him? I worked very well with the speakers. In fact, I supported the previous speakers from the other part of our senatorial zone. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing wrong with them becoming a speaker for two reasons- those people gave my father 100 per cent support in 2015 to go to the Senate. Secondly, they produced ranking members. The motion for the removal of anybody in the House is moved by the Majority Leader and as I explained before, I was Leader for four years and I never moved any motion for the removal of anybody or against this Governor. Now, the person that is the Majority Leader in the House is the brother of the Governor, will I force him to move a motion to remove his brother? Will he have the guts to go back to Obingwa that day? Malicious people always manufacture malicious propaganda. I only wanted people to know me for who I am as a person because even on the day of the inauguration of the Sixth Assembly, the gallery was filled up with people who came to witness my composure in the House. They came to find out if I can even speak proper English, talk less of expressing myself. The impression of me out there was that of an illiterate. Even when my good friend then, Martins Azubuike was removed as a speaker, there were pressures on me to succeed him, I resisted it because I had announced it to the world that I did not want to be a speaker at that time. After that, we elected my other friend, Barrister Chikwendu Kanu as a speaker, and he served out his term meritoriously without any disturbance or distractions. So in 2019, I decided to vie for the position of the speaker because I felt that people must have understood me. The good Lord has been gracious to my family. My father became Chief of Staff for eight years. He was governor for eight years. For the first time in the history of Igboland, a father and a son contested election twice and won. I became a Majority Leader then and now a Speaker. What else do I want? What other favours do I want from God that He has not granted this family? Any aspiration for the position of the governor would be what my father would call vaulting ambition. It is now the turn of others to go and make that same name that we’ve made. Let them go out there to do the needful but whether they like it or not, they will need the help of the youths, the help of the critical stakeholders in Abia, including my family. My advice, once again, to them is instead of using those resources to fund propaganda, they should use it to empower the youths, the women and the critical stakeholders in Abia and leave the rest for the people and God to decide. I cannot respond to every propaganda. I am only responding to it now because I don’t want the governor to be distracted from his job which is enormous. To calm their mind, let me tell you that at any time I wear my suit to go to work, I always have my resignation letter in my pocket; at any time the Governor feels I am no longer protecting his interest or the interest of my colleagues, I will simply submit my resignation letter and go my way. My greatest achievement is the unity of purpose in the House of Assembly. I have a very good working relationship with my colleagues and they have been very supportive in whatever achievement that we have recorded so far especially with the passage of the budget before the end of the last fiscal year. Also, we have all been so much in synergy with the policy thrust of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu that you will not even notice that the House has membership from three political parties. Basically, the achievements could be traced to that, unity of purpose, among my colleagues, respect for each other’s opinion and doing things in consultation with them. The relationship between the executive and the legislature is perfect, in the sense that whatever bill, both economic and social that are brought before us by the executive is given accelerated hearing and importantly, the Governor pays very serious attention to the welfare of the members to the effect that I am bold to state that we rank very high among our colleagues in the South-East, if not the best. Is it my fault that my father has been a governor of a state? Will I disappear from the face of the earth because I am the son of a former governor? I am proud of the accomplishments of my father. I am proud of who he is and what he represents. I have no apologies to give to anybody who feels otherwise. Why won’t I give credit to my father for my accomplishments in life? If that is the insinuation out there, kindly let them know that my father made me what I am today and the present Governor added to my CV by allowing me to become the Speaker of the House with the help of my colleagues. If I follow him everywhere he goes, these same people will accuse me of dictating to him. I am a student of power and I know what it means to be close to a governor. There is no superior governor, every governor is equal. If anybody says I have achieved because of my father, tell them yes, that it is correct. I have no apologies for that. If you go to the House, this question you have asked me will be answered. Pending the assent to the law that we have passed concerning financial autonomy of the House, the House is being well funded as you can see from our environment here. The governor has been able to give a massive facelift to the infrastructure of the House of Assembly. It depends on what you people understand by the word appendage. State Assemblies are not meant to be confrontational to the executives, even the National Assembly is not meant to be confrontational to Mr President. In the previous Assembly, not every senator was against the President. State Assemblies are not supposed to be at loggerheads with their governors, it is supposed to be a partnership. If they are at loggerheads, it will slow down development. That word appendage is not good because if the Assembly does not pass the budget, will the governor perform? There are three independent arms of government that should work in synergy, so I don’t understand the word ‘appendage.’ Is it that for you to prove that you are tough you need to be confrontational to a governor? What for? There is no basis for that. If you are a student of power, you will know that. If you need anything, you get the governor, give him the reasons you need those things, if there are 10 requests he grants you five or six, you go home, you cannot get everything. It is called dialogue- checks and balances. That is the question I would like you to direct to the Governor who is the Chief Security Officer of the state. If the Governor sends an executive bill that will help in the protection of life and property different from the ones we have passed, the House will do justice to it. Well, if you have noticed, my father has said he is retiring from elective politics by 2023. If you have also noticed, we don’t play politics of betrayal and criticism which means that we do not need to engage in destructive criticism of the President just to show that we are in opposition, after all, that is politics? Is it not a reward of loyal people? The President rewards loyal people around him. To answer your question, when we get to the bridge we will know how to cross it because politics is dynamic.
