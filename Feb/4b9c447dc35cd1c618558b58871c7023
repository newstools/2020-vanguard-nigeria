They were reported to have been returning from his mother’s funeral. A source who claims to be related to Daniel said “Daniel mother died months ago and on Saturday, Daniel relatives went for their sister’s burial after Koko where you have to take a boat from Koko to the hinder land. “One of Daniel’s daughter, told the mother of a dream she had, the previous night, but the mother only shouted “God forbid” and dived into long prayers before leaving for Koko from Sapele” the source who craved anonymity said. Another sign of a probable premonition was when the boat, they took from Koko was said to have broken down midway into the journey and the party which consist of Pinky, Daniel’s wife and the 6 other relations too. “They took another boat and after the funeral, they were  returning back when they ran into a truck along  Koko Community to Koko Junction, the vehicle they boarded burnt to ashes with the occupants” Only one person was said to have survived the accident, while the truck driver was said to have abscond from the scene for fear of been lynched.
