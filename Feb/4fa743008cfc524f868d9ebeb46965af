Russian siblings aged 12 and six-years-old died Monday in a speed boat accident off the tourist island of Phuket, an official said, as two vessels collided near a pier. The accident took place 100 metres off a privately-run pier in Phuket, after the speed boat carrying Russian tourists to a nearby island crashed into an incoming vessel. “The cause of the accident was speeding by both the drivers,” a Phuket government official said, requesting anonymity. The brother and sister died in the crash, while “21 other Russians were injured, two critically” he added.
