Akpata moderated the discussions, with speakers presenting and responding to the audience on hot topics that, in addition to the central theme, covered such areas as: How young lawyers can define their career paths; How to succeed as a female lawyer in modern law practice and The changing face of dispute resolution. For maximum reach, the event was designed to coincide with, and form a part of, programmes for the 2020 Bar Week of the Doyen Bar.
