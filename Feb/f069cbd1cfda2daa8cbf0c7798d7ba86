Inter vs Sampdoria, Atalanta vs Sassuolo, Hellas Verona vs Cagliari and Torino vs Parma were all postponed, and although the Naples region remains unaffected as it stands, it seems no chances are being taken. Barca’s visit to ​Napoli is no exception, as the visiting players are to be checked to ensure they are not inadvertently bringing the virus into the country. ​ESPN report that the players and staff will have their temperatures taken and any showing signs of illness will be rushed straight to hospital.
