The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported a US strike during the clashes in the regime-held village of Khirbet Amo, but coalition spokesman Myles Caggins denied any raid had taken place. “Coalition forces, conducting a patrol near Qamishli, Syria, encountered a checkpoint occupied by pro-Syrian regime forces,” Caggins said. “The patrol came under small arms fire from unknown individuals. In self-defence, coalition troops returned fire.” Caggins said the patrol returned safely to base after the situation was “de-escalated”. An AFP correspondent saw a US flag flying above an armoured vehicle as it left the village. According to the Observatory, loyalists residing in the village tried to block the passage of a US military patrol, firing in the air. This prompted a response from US troops, who killed a regime loyalist in the clash, the Observatory said. The coalition did not report such a casualty. Khirbet Amo is among the few areas in the largely Kurdish-held northeast controlled by pro-government forces. US troops in the region operate as part of the US-led coalition fighting the remnants of the Islamic State jihadist group. They routinely carry out patrols in the area alongside their Kurdish allies.
