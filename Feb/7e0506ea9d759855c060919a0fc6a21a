The Japanese consumer electronics giant said its nine-month sales fell 5.4 per cent to 5.76 trillion yen ($53.04 billion) as the weakness of the Chinese market also pressured the performance of the firm’s sales in Japan. “Domestic sales decreased due mainly to sluggish sales in electromechanical control equipment resulting from the deteriorating market conditions in China,” Panasonic said. Sluggish sales of televisions and automotive-related products also dented overall sales.

The company left unchanged its full-year forecast, which sees net profit falling 29.6 per cent to 200 billion yen, and operating profit sagging 27.1 per cent to 300 billion yen on sales at 7.7 trillion yen, down 3.8 per cent. The unchanged forecast comes despite the impact of the new coronavirus, which has sent markets plunging and forced manufacturers to keep plants closed.
