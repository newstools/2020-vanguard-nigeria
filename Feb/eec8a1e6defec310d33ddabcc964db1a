Manchester United were held 1-1 at Club Brugge and Getafe pulled off a surprise 2-0 home win over last year’s Champions League semi-finalists Ajax in other round-of-32, first-leg ties. Inter were frustrated by more than an hour by their Bulgarian opponents until Eriksen fired a low shot into the net from just outside the penalty area in the 71st minute. Romelu Lukaku sealed the win with a stoppage-time penalty, the Belgian striker’s 22nd goal of the season after Anicet Andrianantenaina was judged to have handled following a VAR review. United were quickly in trouble in Belgium when Emmanuel Dennis lobbed the ball over Sergio Romero to give Brugge a 15th- minute lead. But Anthony Martial levelled in the 36th minute when he raced through to place a shot past Simon Mignolet. United, with new midfield signing Bruno Fernandes on the bench, struggled to create many chances, although conditions were difficult with heavy rain and a strong wind. Brazilian pair Deyverson and Kenedy scored in each half for Getafe against Ajax. Deyverson finished off a well-worked free kick to celebrate his European debut for the La Liga club with a goal after 38 minutes and Kenedy broke clear to add a second in the last minute. In other matches, Daichi Kamada scored a hat-trick to help Eintracht Frankfurt to a 4-1 win over coach Adi Huetter’s former club RB Salzburg.
