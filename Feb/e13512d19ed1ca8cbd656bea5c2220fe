Second-placed City are currently 22 points off the pace in the Premier League with rivals Liverpool storming the league having only dropped two points all campaign.

I know the people say ‘You are good’ or ‘You’re not good enough.’ “I accept it. I want to win the Champions League, I dream and will enjoy the games against Real Madrid, to see what I can do. “And this process, the two weeks before, will be the happiest moments of my profession, to imagine what we can do to beat them. “If we don’t beat them, then the chairman will come, or the sporting director, and say ‘It’s not good enough, we want the Champions League, I’m going to sack you’.
