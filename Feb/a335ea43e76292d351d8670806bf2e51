Speaking to  Vanguard,  General Secretary, NPAPWA, Ambrose Duru, said that the group has written to the Minister of Transportation on the matter but added that they were yet to have response as at the time of filling this report. He explained that money from the superannuation fund was used to build the  Ship House  in Abuja which was taken over by the Ministry of Defence in exchange for the BoI Building in Lagos. He added that the pensioners are currently dying without enjoying the benefits of their investment. He stated: “We are not quarrelling with anybody, what we are doing is to demand for our right. This Fund is from the NPA pensioners’ Superannuation Fund/ Legacy Fund and this money invested in the ship house was part of the fund and the reason for the investment is not being realized. “The reason for investing in that Ship House was for a purpose but the purpose is not being realized and pensioners are dying “So it is up to us to ask the minister to take up this matter and how they can compensate us by giving us back the War College property which is currently occupied by BoI and renamed BoI Building and then pay us accrued arrears of rents collected on the property so that the Superannuation Fund can be boosted.” By Godwin Oritse In a bid to enhance the financial profile of its superannuation fund, the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA, has written to the Minister of Transportation requesting that the Bank of Industry, BoI building be returned to the Fund.
