The Commissioner of Health, Dr. Amina Mohammed-Baloni, confirmed the case in a statement on Saturday in Kaduna. Baloni disclosed that the state had so far recorded 23 cases, adding that clinical analysis indicated that 15 of the cases proved negative while one new case confirmed the positive of the disease. She said: “However; six test samples are also pending. The new confirmed case is a 34-year old man from Kajuru Local Government Area  and he is being managed at the isolation center (IDCC). “This brings the number of confirmed cases to two in Kaduna State, as the first victim died on Sunday and has since been buried”. The commissioner revealed that 40 other persons who had contact with the suspected cases were being monitored and none had so far shown any symptoms. Baloni added that contact listing and follow-ups, as well as active case search, were ongoing. She advised the people to maintain a high level of personal hygiene and environmental sanitation as well as ensure that symptoms of fever and malaria are referred to laboratory analysis before treatment. Baloni said that the state government equally adopted proactive measures in compliance with the advisory on the coronavirus issued by the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire. She noted that the measure was a sequel to the Federal Government’s declaration on the Global Public Health Emergency of International Concern. According to her, the minister cautioned Nigerians to limit non-essential travels to China, while those arriving from such countries with no visible symptoms were to be self-isolated for a two week period on arrival in the country. “In addition, arriving travelers also have a duty to report any incidents of passengers falling sick during flights. “Symptoms of coronavirus disease include sneezing, coughing, and difficulties in breathing. People should report to the nearest health facility if any of these symptoms are noticed immediately,” she said. Baloni admonished the people to wash their hands regularly with soap and water, cover the mouth and nose properly with handkerchief and tissue paper when sneezing or cough into the elbow where the handkerchief is not available. “Other protective measures are for the people to avoid self-medication and report to the nearest health facility when experiencing any of the mentioned symptoms. “Health workers are to observe standard infection prevention and control measures while attending to patients, they should also endeavor to take their travel history,” Baloni said. vanguard As 7 doctors, 5 nurses quarantined in Adamawa By Demola Akinyemi, Shina Abubakar, Gabriel Olawale & Ike Uchechukwu Four persons have been confirmed dead in Taraba State just as Kaduna State announced the death of 36-year-old man on Monday following the outbreak of Lassa fever in the country.
