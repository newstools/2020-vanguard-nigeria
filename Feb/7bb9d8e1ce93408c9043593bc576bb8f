The project is to be sited at Oku Iboku community in Itu council of the state. But the House in a resolution vehemently rejected the plan and called on the state government not to release any parcel of land in the state for it. This followed on a motion tabled by a member representing Itu State Constituency, Hon. Kufreabasi Edidem who said that the project was not in tandem with international standards guiding the implementation of civil nuclear programmes across the globe.

He added that the 6th House of Assembly also kicked against the project, yet the regulatory body was still adamant on its establishment in the state. He said, “The 6th Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly through a motion moved by Rt. Hon. Nse Essien, Member representing Onna State Constituency, rejected the planned nuclear power plant, urging the Federal Government to instead of the dangerous venture, explore other available and harmless sources of power in the state, including increasing the capacity of the Ibom Power Plant.” He further cited constant emission of radioactive radiations, discharge of non-biodegradable radioactive wastes, absorption into ecosystem and food chain, as some dangers Akwa Ibom people would be exposed to if the nuclear power plant is cited in Itu LGA or any other part of the state. The Speaker, Aniekan Bassey while responding, commend Hon. Edidem for the timeliness of the Motion and urged the Clerk to communicate the resolution of the House to the appropriate quarters.
