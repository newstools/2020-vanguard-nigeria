Sterling did not rule out playing for Real Madrid in the future in an interview with Spanish outlet AS, although he insisted he was “really happy” at City for now. “The players are free to talk and say what they think,” said Guardiola, who was not concerned at suggestions the England winger could be looking for a way out of the Etihad Stadium. “We are not here to tell them what they have to say.

With calm we decide what we want, but for the next three months the commitment will be incredible.” Guardiola added he had not received any support from rival clubs in the wake of City’s two-year ban from European competition after serious breaches of UEFA’s financial rules.
