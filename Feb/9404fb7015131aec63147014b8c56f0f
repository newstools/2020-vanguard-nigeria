At least 20 people have been crushed to death and 16 others injured during an outdoor religious service in Tanzania. Worshippers were attending a Pentecostal service at a stadium in the northern town of Moshi on Saturday evening when the incident occurred. Moshi district commissioner, Kippi Warioba, said those attending the service rushed forward to be anointed with blessed oil. Tanzania’s President John Magufuli sent his condolences and called for better security at such large events. The service was held by pastor Boniface Mwamposa, who refers to himself as “the apostle.” Survivors said Mr. Mwamposa told hundreds of people gathered at the service to pass through an area where “blessed oil” had been poured over the floor.
