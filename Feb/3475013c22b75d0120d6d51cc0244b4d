Expressing his gratitude, Prince Adeniyi said, “CBIS has a platform for growth and professional development which has earned me enormous new skills and exposure. This is due to the leadership quality of the school. I see the proprietor of the school, Dr Ola Adebogun, as a mentor and role model. I am learning so much from him. He is an icon in education. He is passionate about the development of Education and has contributed immensely to the growth of education in Nigeria. I have a strong sense of belonging here, and collaboration with other teachers is excellent and encouraging. Caleb Group of Schools has a culture of excellence which is in line with my personal goal.” Vanguard At the beginning of the 21st century, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) began to acknowledge the crucial role of arts education as the very foundation to promote creative educational environments and as an essential element of education itself.
