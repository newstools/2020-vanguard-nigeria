Members of the House of Representatives, Tuesday, rejected a motion to evacuate Nigerians stranded in China, following the outbreak of Coronavirus.
According to the lawmakers, who voted massively against the motion raised by the spokesman of the House, Benjamin Okezie, China had better facilities to handle the situation than Nigeria. Despite efforts by the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, to calm the lawmakers and allow Mr Okezie to move his motion, the lawmakers denied him the opportunity.
