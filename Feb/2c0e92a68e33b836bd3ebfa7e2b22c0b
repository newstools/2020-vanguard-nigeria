In his words, marriages today are under a lot of stress and most are known to pack up within a few years. That is why Great Crush Magazine is timely especially as it boasts of quality content. “We have designed it as a monthly magazine. Because of its thrust, the target of the magazine is young people in relationships, and newly married couples. The elderly and experienced are not left out as they can gain a thing or two from the rich content of the publication,” Nnamdi said. Great Crush Magazine is a spinoff of the website which gives out relationship and health tips. One of the aims of diversifying into a hard copy magazine is to reach more people, Boniface added. “In putting this first edition together, we dwelt a lot on quality, and it is something that we have promised to continue with in subsequent editions. All of our writers are experts in their respective fields and so the content we put out can serve as some form of counselling for our readers,” he added.
