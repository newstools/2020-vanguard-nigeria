The defendants, whose residential addresses were not given, are facing charges of conspiracy and stealing. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. According to the Prosecutor, Insp. Samuel Mishozumu, the duo allegedly conspired and stole a Lenovo Laptop worth 250, 000, a property of CNBM Mining Investment Nigeria Ltd. Mishozumu alleged that the defendants committed the offences with others still at large on Jan. 25 at about 7:30 a.m. at No. 5b Afolabi Awosanya St., Ikeja, Lagos. He noted that the defendants stole the Lenovo Laptop which was kept on the office table. “The management of the company suspected the defendants to have stolen the laptop after they found out that they (defendants) were the ones in the office at the time the laptop got missing,” the prosecutor said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the offences violate Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal laws of Lagos State 2015, (revised). NAN reports that stealing from an employer attracts seven years imprisonment while conspiracy is punishable with two years for offenders. The Chief Magistrate, Mr O. D.
