This partnership was initially for 3 years, but because we know how important this is to grassroots football development, we have decided to continue this partnership and we hope for this partnership to go on for many years to come. “By bringing top international coaches from Spain to share LaLiga methodology with their colleagues in Nigeria, we aim to train and develop grassroots football. “For LaLiga, this is one of the most important projects we have in Nigeria and Africa. I hope the coaches not only listen but attempt to implement the insights received, and relay to their various teams to produce the best results”, Castillo stated.
