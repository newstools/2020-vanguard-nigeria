We’re just really delighted to get the three points, especially going into the break now.” It was yet another top-quality display from Firmino, who provided a hat-trick of assists against the Saints, and he showcased why he is highly-regarded by his fans and his teammates. Firmino joined Liverpool for just £29 million in 2015 , and has played a huge part in Liverpool’s recent success. The Reds are now 22 points clear at the top of the Premier League table, and they are edging closer to Arsenal’s 49 games unbeaten run.
