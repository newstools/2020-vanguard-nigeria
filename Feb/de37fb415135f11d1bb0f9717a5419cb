Ugwuanyi in the state. Chief Ogbonna added that the governor’s penchant for peace and deep commitment to participatory democracy through wider consultation and consensus-building were responsible for the existing peace and security in the state. He maintained that the governor’s uncommon leadership style also ensured the peace that exists in the State Assembly, describing the governor as a rare leader who does not segregate or hold grudges against anybody. The Ohanaeze Chairman, therefore, called on residents of the state to support Gov. Ugwuanyi, stressing that “he is the kind of person we want.” Also speaking, the Senator representing Enugu North Senatorial District, Senator Chukwuka Utazi, who spoke on behalf of the members of the National Assembly from the state, extolled the leadership qualities of Gov.

Ugwuanyi and will all be at the grand finale of the chairmanship campaign, next week, to demonstrate their solidarity and support for the governor and the party.

Speaking on behalf of members of the State Assembly, the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Edward Ubosi, equally commended Gov. Ugwuanyi for inclusive governance style and commitment to peace and delivery of dividends of democracy to the people of the state, in spite of the nation’s economic challenges. The speaker stated that the governor as the leader of the PDP in the state “is leading us well”, disclosing: “that is why the party is waxing strong in the state”. Ubosi also appreciated the state leadership of the party for the mobilization and huge turnout of party members and supporters at the rally, stating that the governor’s good works and uncommon leadership style will ensure victory for the party. He pointed out that the participatory democracy entrenched by the governor was responsible for the calibre of persons who emerged as candidates of the party in the 17 local government areas of the state, stating that “they are the choice of the people”. In his speech, the PDP state chairman, Hon. Augustine Nnamani stated that the party is alive in the state because of the remarkable achievements of the governor, who he said has kept faith with his campaign promises. The chairman, who presented the party’s flags to the chairmanship candidates alongside their deputies, urged the electorate to vote for PDP. Gov.
