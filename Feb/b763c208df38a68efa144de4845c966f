The UN agency has been sending testing kits, masks, gloves, respirators and gowns to every region, Tedros told the WHO Executive Board in Geneva. “However, the world is facing a chronic shortage of personnel protective equipment, as you might imagine. “This afternoon I will be speaking to the pandemic supply chain network to identify the bottlenecks and find solutions and push (for) fairness in the distribution of equipment,” he said. As of 6 a.m. Geneva time (0500 GMT) there were 31,211 confirmed coronavirus cases in China and 637 deaths, as well as 270 cases in 24 other countries with 1 death, Tedros said. “For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that. The numbers could go up again,” he said. During its technical briefing for member states, there was discussion about naming the virus – which emerged in a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December. WHO has already assigned an interim name of 2019-nCOV (novel coronavirus) acute respiratory disease. “We thought it very important that we provide an interim name so no location was associated with the name. “I’m sure you have seen many media reports that are still calling this, using the name Wuhan or using China,” WHO Epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told the board. “We wanted to ensure that there was no stigma associated with this virus, and so we’ve put out this interim name,” she said. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, said: “I think the bigger point here is to ensure that some of the actions, some of the reactions internationally, it is the responsibility of us all to ensure there is no stigma associated with this disease. “The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop. “Governments have a responsibility to communicate with their populations on this,” Ryan told the board. vanguard World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday there was no need for measures that “unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” in trying to halt the spread of a coronavirus that has killed 361 people in China. “We call on all countries to implement decisions that are… February 3, 2020 In "News" THE Senate has summoned the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire to appear before it and brief the lawmakers on the preparedness of his ministry towards taking precautionary measures to ensure that there was no possible outbreak of the Coronavirus in Nigeria.
