The defendants identified as Harry Uyanwanne, senior pastor of temple international church and Oluwakemi Odemuyiwa (a.k.a Kristein Uyanwanne) were arraigned alongside with the church Temple International. They were arraigned by the Economic Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) before Justice Mojisola Dada on a seven counts charge of conspiracy, stealing and obtaining money by false pretence. According to the EFCC prosecutor, S.O Daji, the offence committed is contrary to section 278, 278 (1) (b), 285, 285(1) of the criminal law of Lagos state of Nigeria, No 11, 2011 and section 1 (2) and (3) Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offence Act.

Daji further alleged that the defendants dishonestly converted the sum of N10,000,000
property of late Mrs Odemuyiwa Janet Adeola to their own use. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the alleged offences slammed against them by the commission. In view of their plea, the prosecutor asked the court to remand the defendants in the prison custody.
