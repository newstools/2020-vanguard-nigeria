Canada-based Shopify signed on as a member of the Libra Association after a string of companies dropped out in the face of criticism by regulators worried the borderless digital money is a threat to national sovereignty. “We spend a lot of our time thinking about how to make commerce better in parts of the world where money and banking could be far better,” Shopify said in a blog post. “We’re excited to be part of the Libra Association and look forward to how the project may improve commerce everywhere.” Shopify planned to work with the association to build a payment network the makes money easier to access by businesses and consumers no matter their locations, according to the post.

Countries and central banks — for now the only entities legally permitted to issue currency — have also expressed concern about a blow to their sovereignty.
