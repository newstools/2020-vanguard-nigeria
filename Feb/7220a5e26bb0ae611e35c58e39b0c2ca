He ran towards them,” a police statement said. “Police responded by calling upon the terrorist to stop. He continued to approach them and they responded again by shooting the terrorist to prevent any further danger. The terrorist was shot and killed.” A woman in the area was “injured lightly by shrapnel” and taken to hospital, the statement added. Police did not immediately release further details on the identity of the suspect. But the Palestinian health ministry named the alleged assailant as 33-year-old Maher Za’atara from annexed east Jerusalem. There has been an uptick in violence since US President Donald Trump’s announcement on January 28 of a controversial peace plan that Palestinians from across the political spectrum have angrily dismissed as a gift to Israel. On Friday, police reported an attempted stabbing south of Jerusalem. At the start of the month, a Jerusalem car-ramming wounded 14 people, 12 of them Israeli soldiers, and triggered clashes in the West Bank that saw five Palestinians killed.
