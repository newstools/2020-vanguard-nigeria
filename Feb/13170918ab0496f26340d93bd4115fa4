Macky Sall on Monday said even wealthy countries “had a lot of difficulties” evacuating their nationals, local media reported. “This requires logistics that are totally outside of Senegal’s reach,” he added. The central Chinese city has been locked down and 12 Senegalese students are stuck in the city, local media have reported.
