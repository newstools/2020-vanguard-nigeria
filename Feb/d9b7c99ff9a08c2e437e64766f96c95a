Following the sack of Bayelsa governor-elect, David Lyon and his Deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremieoyo by the apex court, the presidential candidate of the People Democratic Party, PDP, in the last general elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has Thursday said that Nigerians are solidly behind Supreme Court in their verdicts. Atiku who congratulated Senator Douye Diri, the newly declared winner of Bayelsa gubernatorial election, advised the apex court to show consistency in its judgments. Recall that Supreme Court, had barely seven hours, sacked the governor-elect, David Lyon and his Deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremieoyo, of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The apex court, in a unanimous decision by a five-man panel of Justices led by Justice Mary Odili, held that Degi-Eremieoyo presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. In view of that therefore, Atiku opined: “I received the verdict of the Supreme Court, declaring the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Bayelsa state gubernatorial elections, Senator Douye Diri, as the duly elected Governor of the state, with gladness. “Senator Douye Diri had cause to visit with me before the elections and received my blessings and counsel. I am fully satisfied that he has what it takes to make Bayelsa the ‘glory of all lands’. His intellect, personality and character, are a credit to Bayelsa and the PDP. “I congratulate Senator Douye Diri and his running mate, Mr. Lawrence Ewhrujakpor. I also felicitate with the Peoples Democratic Party. The Lords Justices have given us another opportunity to show Nigerians that power belongs to the people, and we must make good use of this opportunity.<img class="size-full wp-image-1290766 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-Lyon.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> “I call on all the people of Bayelsa to make peace with the recent past and embrace the future together, united in the mission to transform the state into a haven of peace and prosperity. “Finally, I urge the Supreme Court to show consistency in its judgments and find the resolve to always deliver just-judgments no matter whose ox is gored. The people of Nigeria are behind the apex court in whatever they do to free themselves from the dominance of dictatorial forces.” Vanguard The Supreme Court, on Thursday, sacked the governor-elect of Bayelsa State, David Lyon and his Deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremieoyo.
