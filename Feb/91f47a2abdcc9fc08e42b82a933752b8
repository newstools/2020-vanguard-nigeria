Oluwasola made the call in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) as the world commemorates the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation with the theme ‘Unleashing the Youth Power’. He said “we need more of government’s intervention in terms of policy. “If there is a law in the country that bans female genital mutilation practice, it becomes easier to prosecute whoever is still practising it.

Oluwasola added that though awareness was better than before, more was needed to completely eradicate the harmful age-long practice. He noted that “many people in the rural areas still carry out the practice but many Non-Governmental Organisations(NGOs) are now liaising with the people to let them know that the practice is harmful and to find a way of reducing transmission of infection from the practice”. The expert noted this was a plus for medical professionals as those who still practice the act were gradually understanding the harm in the practice. (NAN) VANGUARD
