Azeez said that the defendant, punched Latifat Salami, to death during a fight. He said that the victim and the defendant, who were neighbours did not get along and harboured a lot of animosity towards each other. “Robinson was told by another neighbour that Salami had taken a photo of her without her knowledge while she (Salami) was sitting in the compound making her hair. “The next morning, the defendant confronted the deceased and there was a heated exchange of words between them which degenerated into a fight. “During the fracas, Robinson punched Salami on her chest, she became unconscious and eventually died,” Azeez said.
