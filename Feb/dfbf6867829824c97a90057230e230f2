Ahmed said in a statement  yesterday in Lagos,  said the real GDP growth rate was impressive, in view of the fact that the 4th quarter record represented the highest quarterly growth performance since the 2016. “But it is still largely below the desirable because the 2.55 per cent growth is still below the population growth rate of 2.6 percent. “The full year figure of the real GDP of 2.27 per cent in 2019 when compared with the 1.91 per cent of 2018 reveals a promising but cautious improvement of economic performance. “This is encouraging, especially because it obviously surpassed the 2.1 per cent projections of the IMF apparently due to the usual heavy seasonal activities transaction,” he said. He, however, expressed doubt about its sustainability in the coming quarters due to unfriendly operating environment. “This doubt will be overcome if government ensures that its Ease of Doing Business reforms reduce the cost of doing business. “This will result in a real GDP growth that may again surpass the 2.0 per cent projection for 2020,” he said.
