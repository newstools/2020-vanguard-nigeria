Earlier she laid off 80 percent of the staff. Obnoxious estimated billing on electricity where she spent N3m in one of her 52 filling stations and hardly got a supply for three days in a week did not also help matters. The Edo State-born lawyer, having been in the industry for over 35 years, helped Ascon Group to expand into the blending of lube oils and operation of truck parks. She also operated tank farms and several filling stations across the country. A professional career woman with deep sense of philanthropy, Olowofoyeku typifies an outstanding study in humility and she has moved on to other things. Today, she has diversified to farming, by owning cassava plantations and producing garri and rice. She lost her husband when things were about to reach the level of success and she had to carry on with the struggle alone. Ascon Oil is the story of an idea defying all odds, born in the mind of one of Nigeria’s brightest visionaries who came, who saw and who conquered, George Enenmoh, the founding Managing Director, passed on in 2005 in a plane crash. From 2005 when Enenmoh passed on, the baton of leadership was passed to Grace. Under her leadership, the company has grown in leaps and bounds, expanding its retail outlets from 11 to 52. Vanguard News 11 Plc, formerly  Mobil Oil Nigeria Plc, has petitioned police authorities over Ascon Oil Nigeria Limited alleged occupation of a filling station, located in a piece of land belonging to the late Chief Sunday Ogunyade in Gbagada, Lagos. September 25, 2018 In "Energy" Mrs Enenmoh had, in an earlier petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, dated June 27, 2018, asserted that Mobil’s continuous operations at the filling station was in contempt of court and constituted an economic crime August 19, 2018 In "News" Barely 24 hours after reports indicated the possibility of partial deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector, and days the country had a breather from scarcity, long queues have resurfaced at filling stations across the country, as most of them indulged in product hoarding ahead of the deregulation.
