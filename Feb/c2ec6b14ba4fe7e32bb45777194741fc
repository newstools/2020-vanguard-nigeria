China hopes the killer virus, which has claimed more than 1,000 lives and struck down over 44,500 people, will be curbed by April.

Professor Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine in the city, said on Tuesday even if the coronavirus kills just 1 per cent of sufferers, it could still wipe out as many as 45million people. The WHO has long believed that a new disease pandemic could rapidly race around the world and destabilise society, due to modern air travel. Dr. Ghebreyesus’ stark warning was a more broad statement about new unknown viruses, not specifically the Chinese coronavirus. It comes after the United Nations health agency gave the illness its official name, COVID-19. CO stands for corona, VI for the virus, D for disease and 19 for the year it emerged, Dr. Ghebreyesus explained on Tuesday when it was revealed. vanguard Masks may offer a "false sense of security" if they are used wrongly by people protecting themselves against viruses (coronavirus), medical experts said.
