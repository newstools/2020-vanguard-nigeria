Lawan made the appeal on Thursday when the Ambassador of Finland in Nigeria, Dr.Jyrki Pulkkinen paid him a courtesy visit in his office. “Finland and Nigeria have gone a long way in terms of the diplomatic relationship since about 1963. Since then, Nigeria and Finland have been friends. “There is something that we know about you. And that is to collaborate with the Hi-Tech country that you are. “And Nigeria today is looking for Hi-Tech. In fact, recently the Ministry of Communications was renamed as the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. That is to emphasise the need for Nigeria to go the Hi-Tech way as well. “We need our friends who are in hi-tech like your country to help us develop to that level that we dream of reaching,” Lawan said. The Senate President told his guest that Nigeria is going through some challenges that so much require the application of technology to overcome. “As you know, Nigeria is battling with so many issues of insecurity. We have the insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and many other things. “The best way to go is to deploy the technology. Even though at the beginning, it may be a little bit expensive but in the long run, it pays off better. “We believe that with you as our friend, you can find appropriate technology for our armed forces and the police to fight the challenges that we face,” Lawan said. The Senate President also, through Finland, appealed for the support of the European Union. “As a member of the European Union, we need our friends at this moment probably more than ever before. “Nigeria faces, in addition to insecurity, the challenge of economic development as well. We have a lot of areas that require the support of the European Union. “When we export our agricultural products, most of the time, we face issues. The European Union will say we have not met standards or that there are some issues. “I think the time has come for the European Union to take the step that is necessary as a friend of Nigeria. That is to ensure that there is a conscious effort to establish maybe an office in Nigeria where we will be given the standards and be supported to meet the standards. “So that when we export our agricultural products, whether in their raw forms as commodities or semi-processed or even processed, the issue of the standard will not stop our exporters from getting access and of course sale of their products. That happens in other countries. “The European Union remains a major partner of Nigeria when it comes to diplomacy. So we are taking this opportunity to appeal to you: Help us set the standards but make us meet the standards. “Whatever you do in other countries to help them meet the standard that is required, we are prepared to meet the standard. Because Nigeria is blessed…. But we are constraint when it comes to exporting our agricultural products. “So help us along that line, Look into that and see if there is anything you can do to facilitate trade between the two countries….We really have to work hard to improve the trade between the two countries,” Lawan said. Dr. Pulkkinen his mission was to inform the Senate President of the impending visit to Nigeria of a parliamentary committee on Finance from Finland. vanguard PRESIDENT of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan said Wednesday that  the National Assembly has begun  consultation with the Executive arm of government on a new version of the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB  to be introduced in the ninth National Assembly February 5, 2020 In "News" The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Tuesday sought the assistance of the British High Commission in Nigeria to help in capacity enhancement for the lawmakers.
