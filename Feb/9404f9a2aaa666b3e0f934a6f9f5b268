The shooter was shot dead in a mall where he had holed up, police spokesman Krissana Pattanacharoen also confirmed in a statement. The shooter was identified as 32-year-old Sergeant Jakrapanth Thomma. He reportedly shot dead his commanding officer before stealing heavy weapons and a military Humvee from a military base and going on a killing frenzy. He shot and killed dozens of people in his path as he fled, including at a Buddhist temple. He then went on a rampage at a shopping mall in Nakhon Ratchasima, north-east of the capital Bangkok.
