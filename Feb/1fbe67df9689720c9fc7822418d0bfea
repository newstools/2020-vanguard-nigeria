The advice which was contained in the Lagos State government public advisory issued today through the State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi noted that unsupervised self-quarantine for travelers is the first step in containing Corona Virus in the State. “Self-quarantine is a public health strategy used to separate and isolate individuals who may have been exposed to a communicable disease. The aim is to protect individuals who may have been exposed and the general public. “During unsupervised self-quarantine, we expect persons concerned to respond to the State advise and act as responsible citizens. ” You are required to restrict your movement to your home, monitor yourself closely, report any symptoms that may develop to the Ministry of Health on the contact numbers provided and engage in good personal hygiene”, Abayomi said. Continuing, the Commissioner explained that persons observing self-quarantine must stay at home during the whole duration of the self-quarantine, and must avoid workplace, minimize contact with family members, ensure no contact with visitors, refrain from attending or going to public or social functions and must not ride or fly in any mode of public transportation. “You must monitor yourself closely and diligently during the self-quarantine period, to identify if you develop symptoms including, but not limited, to headache, cough, sore throat, fever, chest pain, chills, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties and pneumonia”, he added Abayomi stressed the need for citizens observing self-quarantine who develop any of the aforementioned symptoms to immediately contact the Ministry of Health on 08023169485, 08033565529 and 08052817243 for further instructions. He said the Virus Infection has an incubation period of 5 to 14 days. “This means if you have been in China or any other country that is now experiencing Coronavirus transmission from person to person, you may become unwell after a period of 5 to 14 days of your return. If you feel unwell or develop symptoms, immediately contact the Ministry of Health on the numbers provided to communicate how you are feeling.” He dismissed the report of a case of the virus in the state and urged citizens to disregard the misinformation as well as any other information about the virus that did not emanate from his office, the State Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Health or the National Centre for Disease Control. vanguard ...Urges China returnees to observe self-quarantine By Sola Ogundipe & Chioma Obinna Contrary to a media report on alleged suspected case of the coronavirus in a hospital in Lekki area of Lagos, facts on Sunday, emerged that the person just arrived from China and needed to be monitored as part… February 3, 2020 In "Features" Dismisses media report By Sola Ogundipe & Chioma Obinna Contrary to a media report on an alleged suspected case of the coronavirus in a hospital in Lekki area of Lagos, facts yesterday emerged that the person just arrived from China and needed to be monitored as part of the response… February 2, 2020 In "Health" By Sola Ogundipe The Pentagon is preparing military installations too, if necessary, quarantine up to 1,000 people returning to the United States from overseas to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, the Department of Defense announced Saturday.
