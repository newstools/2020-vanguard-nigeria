At a public function last year, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Mohammad Tanko raised concerns over the heavy workload on justices of the Supreme Court. The CJN pointed out that it would be difficult for the justices to cope with the volume of cases before them if nothing is done urgently. Although not expressly stated by the CJN, one of the core factors responsible for the issue raised by him is the number of justices at the apex court. At the moment, there are 13 Justice of the Supreme Court, whereas section 230 (2) (b) of the 1999 constitution provides that; “ The Supreme Court of Nigeria shall consist of such number of Justices not exceeding 21 as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly.” Successive governments have also overlooked the need to have the maximum 21 justices as stipulated by the constitution. Law and Human Right investigation revealed that seven out of the current 13 Supreme Court Justices would most likely retire on or before 2023 having reached the 70 years mandatory retirement age.
