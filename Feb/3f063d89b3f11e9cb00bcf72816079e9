China injected 1.7 trillion yuan ($242.74 billion) via reverse repos on Monday and Tuesday, helping Chinese stocks reverse some losses and lifting the world equity index.MIWD00000PUS.

Tesla shares hit $900 Shares of Tesla Incorporated surged 15percent yesterday to hit the $900 mark, extending a stunning rally that has more than doubled the company’s market value since the start of the year as more investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s vision. The latest surge was partly fueled by Panasonic Corp saying yesterday its automotive battery venture with Tesla was in the black for the first time. Some analysts have attributed the rally to short covering as well. Short interest in Tesla stood at 13.8 percent as of Jan. 30, according to Refinitiv data. Shares of heavily shorted companies can at times get pushed higher as traders rush to buy stock to cover their short bets, triggering what is known as a “short squeeze”. Panasonic shares closed up 10 percent, while those of Tesla’s Asian suppliers South Korea’s LG Chem Limited and China’s CATL also closed higher.
