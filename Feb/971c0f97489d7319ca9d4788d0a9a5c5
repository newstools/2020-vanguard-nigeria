Officers from the Guardia di Finanza, Italy’s tax police, discovered widespread cheating at the Grassi hospital in Ostia, a seaside suburb of the Italian capital. The Guardia di Finanza said in a statement they started checking hospital staff in November 2017 after being warned about a dishonest nurse in the surgery unit. She did not turn out to be an isolated case. According to police, a total of 523 people were spared from paying hospital taxes, which vary, but can run into dozens of euros.
