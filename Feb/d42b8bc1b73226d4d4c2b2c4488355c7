If the club didn’t value me the way they should have, it wasn’t my decision.”I would’ve loved to stay, but as I say, it wasn’t my call. “Five years later, Ronaldo was back in Spain as he became one of the Galactico signings at Real Madrid.”I joined Real Madrid because I just wanted to play there,” he said.”My dream was to play for Real Madrid one day and I fought hard so that it could happen. “Roberto Carlos was with me in the national team and he was always telling me what Real Madrid meant for everyone.”That left a very good impression and after some years I wanted to see it with my own eyes. “The truth is it is a bigger club than he was telling me!”There’s a big expectation every time and also a lot of pressure because we always have the world’s best players.”I loved to know that I could make Real Madrid an even bigger club. “There were many expectations about Los Galacticos and in the end, we delivered a good show, we were a winning group who changed the way business was handled in the world of football.”Since our group appeared every team started generating more money, they sold their players in a better way and it was a big change that created a new era for football.” Marca Vanguard News Cristiano Ronaldo cast a shadow over Real Madrid's third consecutive Champions League triumph by suggesting he could have played his last game for the Spanish giants in Saturday's 3-1 win over Liverpool in Kiev.
