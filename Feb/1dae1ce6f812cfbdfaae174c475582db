He explained that 68 pipeline points were vandalized, representing about 94 per cent increase from the 35 points that were breached in October 2019, adding that out of the vandalised points, 15 failed to be welded while only two pipeline points were ruptured. Giving a breakdown of the breach, the NNPC noted that the Mosimi-Ibadan axis accounted for 31 per cent of the breaks; Atlas Cove-Mosimi network witnessed 19 per cent, while Ibadan-Ilorin and other routes accounted for 15 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.

Comparatively, he stated that the October 2019 gas supply to power averaged 553mmscfd to generate 2,050 MW. Makoji added that national gas production in November 2019 stood at 228.65 billion Cubic Feet (BCF), translating to an average daily production of 7,621.68 million Standard Cubic Feet per day (mmscfd). He said, “For the period November 2018 to November 2019, a total of 3,091.24BCF of gas was produced, representing an average daily production of 7,882.27mmscfd during the period, according to the report. “A period-to-date Production from Joint Ventures (JVs), Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) contributed about 69.50 per cent, 21.06 per cent and 9.44 per cent respectively to the total national gas production. “Out of the total volume of gas supplied in November 2019, 137.02BCF of gas was commercialized, consisting of 35.29BCF and 101.73BCF for the domestic and export market respectively. “This translates to a total supply of 1,176.40mmscfd of gas to the domestic market and 3,391.04mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for the month, implying that 59.91 per cent of the average daily gas produced was commercialized, while the balance of 40.09 per cent was re-injected, used as upstream fuel gas or flared. “Gas flare rate was 8.29 per cent for the month under review, i.e. 632.37mmscfd, compared with an average gas flare rate of 8.80 per cent, i.e. 692.97mmscfd for the period November 2018 to November 2019.” Vanguard By Michael Eboh Nigeria earned $504.44 million, an equivalent of N154.73 billion, from crude oil and gas exports in November 2019, according to data released by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.
