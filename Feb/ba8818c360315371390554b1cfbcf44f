The defendant, an auto mechanic, who resides at 25, Ogunjobi St., Oke Odo, Abule Egba Road in Lagos State, is standing trial for conspiracy and stealing. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, ASP Raji Akeem, told the court that the defendant committed the offences in May 2015 at Pleasure Bus stop, Abule Egba Road in Lagos. Akeem said that the truck, owned by Chase Express Service Limited, had an accident and was towed to the defendant’s workshop.
