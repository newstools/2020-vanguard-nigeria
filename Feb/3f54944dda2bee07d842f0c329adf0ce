Speaking at the event, the CEO of Macima Media Group, owners of FoodBay TV, Femi Ogundoro observed that food is big everywhere in the world, adding that nothing stops it being bigger in Nigeria. “With over 200,000,000 people, diverse cultures and tribes, why won’t food be bigger in Nigeria? One thing that can bring us together, either as African or Nigerians, is actually food. The challenge is that the government and international organisations are talking about food in a way the consumers do not understand. They talk about food security, they talk about agriculture… it is still food. That’s what we stand for as FoodBay TV, which is a 24-hour channel to be launched very soon. We are focused on getting the best of food and putting African food on the world food map.” The event took place at the Eagles Club, Sururlere, Lagos, the grand finale and was hosted by OAP Dotun and Soliat Bada, while the duo of Zlatan and Teni, treated the excited crowd to the best of their recordings. It was cheers all the way, as the artistes belted songs from their rich repertoires.
