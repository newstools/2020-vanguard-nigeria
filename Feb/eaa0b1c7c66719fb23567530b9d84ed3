The Nigerian international is in the middle of his first season away from Arsenal, having left the Gunners last summer to join Everton in a deal worth around £35million. It has been a mixed campaign so far for Iwobi, who has scored two goals in 21 appearances in all competitions, with the forward missing several weeks over the busy festive period. But he returned to action for the Toffees on Saturday as Everton came from behind to beat Watford at Vicarage Road, moving up to eighth in the Premier League. “They are almost the same, thinking about it,” Iwobi told the Liverpool Echo. “They are both very patient, they are not men of many words but when they do say something there is a lot of wisdom. They are almost the same. “They both like to play football, it is almost like I am working with the same man. “It’s not like I’m back at Arsenal with Arsene Wenger, but it’s almost the same philosophy and I can buy into it easily and adapt to his plans straight away.” Vanguard News Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti has ruled out Alex Iwobi from their Premier League game against Burnley on Boxing Day and the midfielder could be out of action until the New Year.
