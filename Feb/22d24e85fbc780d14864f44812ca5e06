In the video, the young rapper from Mecca, who identifies herself as Asayel Slay, praises what she describes as bold women in Islam’s holiest city. Wearing a headscarf and sunglasses, she describes the women as “sugar candy” in the song titled “Mecca Girl”. But Mecca governor Khaled al-Faisal has ordered the arrest of those behind the video, saying in a statement on Twitter that it “offends the customs and traditions” of local Saudis.

Minaj, however, pulled out of the concert in what she described as a show of support for women’s and gay rights in the kingdom. De facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has scrapped decades-old bans on cinemas and women drivers while allowing gender-mixed concerts and sports tournaments. The relaxed social norms have been welcomed by many Saudis, two-thirds of whom are under 30.
