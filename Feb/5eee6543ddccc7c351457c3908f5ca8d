The 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines was from Wuhan, the city that has been ground-zero for the Coronavirus epidemic. Here is what we know — and don’t know — about him: – Where he visited –

Health department authorities said the pair travelled to the central island of Cebu and then the city of Dumaguete, which is on a neighbouring island. Cebu Pacific airline said it was working with health authorities to track down passengers from the two flights they took. – How he died –
Days after arriving in the Philippines the pair went to see a doctor with symptoms like cough and fever. They were both admitted to hospital from January 25, she with a “mild cough” and him with pneumonia, the national health department said.

National health authorities said Thursday the woman had tested positive for the virus, the Philippines’ first confirmed case. However, they did not offer any specific information about the man.
