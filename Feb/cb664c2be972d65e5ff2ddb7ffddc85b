The Research Associate of Centre for the Study of Economies of Africa, Mma Amara Ekeruche disclosed at a media briefing organized by the Environmental Rights Action /Friends of the Earth Nigeria, ERA/FoEN in Abuja.

It further demanded,  “Conformity with the provisions of the NTC Act 2015 which limits and requires transparency of interactions between government and the tobacco industry.” Oluwafemi in a text he read said, “It is worth mentioning that this year started on a good note with the gazetting of the National Tobacco Control (NTC) Regulations 2019. “The Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) and the entire tobacco control community commend the Federal Ministries of Health and Justice for the strategic roles they played to ensure the gazetting happened. “As you all must have noticed, it had been a winding road since the Regulations were approved by the Eighth National Assembly mid-2019 until the gazette finally happened. “While the process lingered, we did not relent in making our views known to government that Nigerians should not be made to wait too long to join the global community in checking an industry determined to ensure a chokehold on the lungs of users of its products in our country. With the gazette, we do not feel it is time yet time for celebrations. “It might interest you to know that the tobacco industry has not been sleeping. They have remained ingenious, working on new tactics to remain relevant and true to their bidding of stifling any form of regulation. ” For months we have noticed an up-tick in their so-called Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities at state and national levels and on the social media space.” Vanguard Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria ERA/FoEN has said Federal Government was taking too long to gazette the National Tobacco Control Regulations following the passage of the National Tobacco Control, NTC, Act 2019 by the National Assembly in May.
