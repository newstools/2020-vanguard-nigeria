A person who is imprisoned or detained has a right to an early trial or be released on bail, James Danbaba vs The State 2000 14 NWLR (Pt 687) 396 at 409. Where there is a delayed investigation or trial a person can apply for bail pending the conclusion of investigation or trial. Bail, therefore, is applicable in three stages: bail before trial; (2) bail during trial; and (3) bail after conviction. We shall start with bail before trial. What is bail? Bail is a common word in every society, however, its meaning and applicability may not be known or understood by all. Bail is a legal word which has its origin from the French word “brailler” meaning “to deliver” The Nigerian Law Dictionary by S.1 Nichi 71. Bail simply means to set at liberty somebody who has been arrested or imprisoned Emeka Ekwenugo vs F.A.G 2001 6 NWLR (Pt 708) 17 where it was held as follows: “It literally means to set at liberty a person arrested or imprisoned on security being taken for his appearance on a day and a day certain.” Bail is applicable to both criminal and civil matters. Bail in civil matters is used mainly to secure directly or indirectly payment of debt or performance of civil duties Johnson vs Shaffer 28 N.E. 2d 765. Bail is applicable to both common law and statutes. At common law all felons are bailable In Re Nottingham Corporation 1897 2 Q.B. 502. At common law all courts have inherent jurisdiction to grant bail R vs Spilsbury 1898 2 Q.B. 615 where it was held as follows: “…court has independently of statute by common law, jurisdiction to admit to bail.” The function of bail in criminal matters is to release a person detained or arrested to regain his freedom by way of bail with or without condition to enable him appear in court on a day certain Johnson vs Shaffer supra held as follows: “…while in criminal cases object is to secure appearance of a person before the court when his presence is needed.” Bail is not only granted to a natural person, bail can be granted to a sea or ocean going vessels, ships, boats etc, that is, admiralty proceedings. A ship seized may be granted bail, based on two principles of law. These principles of law are best arguable case and the value of the ship Delta Steel Co vs Aditya Prablia 1987 – 90 3 NSC 602. A person who has not been tried and convicted by a court is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty S.36 (5) of the 1999 Constitution as amended. This presumption of innocence of an accused person is preserved and reinforced by granting an accused person bail pending and during trial Stacks vs Boyle 342 U.S 1951 where it was held as follows: “Unless this right to bail before trial is preserved, the presumption of innocence secured only after centuries of struggle would loose its meaning.” The constitutionality of bail is recognised and contained in the common law, all constitutions ever operated in Nigeria and the CPA Sections 118 – 142 and CPC Sections 340 – 355 reinforced by decisions of courts interpreting the constitutional provisions of bail see S 36 (5) of the 1999 Constitution, Chief Pius Anaekwe vs COP 1996 3 NWLR (Pt 436) 320. Section 6 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights have given all those living in Africa the freedom of bail. Bail is applicable only when the freedom of movement guaranteed to an individual has been restricted or restrained Jahar Mal vs The State 1954 A.I.R (Raj) 279 where it was held as follows: “The conclusion, therefore, at which we arrived, is that there must be some kind of restraint to him before a person who appears before court, is granted bail by court.” Anticipatory bail is not granted in most states in the world. However, India practices what may be termed as anticipatory bail Amir Chand vs The Crown 1950 A.I.R. (E.P.) 58 where it was held as follows: “In the case of a person who is not under arrest but whose arrest warrant have been issued, bail can be allowed if he appears in court and surrenders himself.” Anticipatory bail is not granted in serious cases or to a person being investigated for serious offences Samunder Singh 1987 A.I.R. (S.C.) 737. Anticipatory bail is like enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed under S. 46 (1) of the Constitution, one need not wait unless he is apprehended, a person who reasonably fears his fundamental right is eminently about to be violated can stop it by applying S.46(1) of the Constitution supra. In the language of bail the phrases “admitted to bail” and “granted or released on bail” is frequently interchangeably used, it has been held in Juhal Mal. Vs The State supra to mean the same thing as follows: “The basic idea in both these sections is the release of a person concerned on bail, and the use of different expressions namely “released on bail” in one and “admitted on bail” in the other does not, in our opinion make any difference to the meaning, and both sections are meant for the release of a person on bail.” To grant or not grant bail by court is discretionary R vs Abdullahi Jamal 16 NLR 54 as follows: “The position is therefore clear that I have a clear discretion as to granting bail.” Though, granting bail is discretionary of a court the discretion must be exercised according to the rules of reason and justice and not according to private opinion Sharpe vs Wakefield 1891 A.C. 173. Discretion is exercised according to common sense and justice Gardner vs Jay 1885 29 Ch. D. 58. A discretion in law must be exercised judicially and in accordance with established principles Adamu Muri vs 1GP 1957 NNLR 5, it must be exercised judicially and judiciously Dana Impex vs Stephen Aderotoye 2006 All FWLR (Pt 308) 1388. The purpose of granting bail is for a person detained to regain his freedom, bail conditions must therefore not be excessive or unreasonable to enable an accused person fulfil the conditions and regain his freedom Mathias Onuigbo vs COP 1975 NNLR 34 held as follows: “…bail must not be excessive. Excessive bail might amount to no bail at all because the accused person may not be able to comply with the term.” See also El-Alim Mirghani vs Sudan Gov’t 1960 S.L.J.R 68. Where excessive bail conditions are granted it can be reviewed by courts SS 334, 125 CPC and CPA respectively, Mathias Onuigbo vs C.O.P supra. There are two types of bail Mathias Onuigbo vs C.O.P supra as follows: “Bail is mainly of two types: (1) Self recognisance by which the accused person is merely asked to enter into bond of certain sum of money which may be estregated in full in case he fails to turn up on a given date; (1) Bond with surety or sureties by which he is asked to enter a bond of a fixed sum of money and the surety the same bond by which they bind themselves to forfeit a fixed sum of money in case of default of appearance by the accused person.” Failure to fulfil bail bond terms can lead to forfeiting the bond, cancellation of the bail and re-arrested of the accused person Ss. 348 and 121 CPC and CPA respectively. A court can order deposition of money in a court as a fulfillment of bail terms Mathias Onuagbo vs C.O.P supra.
