Goretzka and Boateng were pictured in a bust-up on Wednesday as Bayern prepared for Saturday’s Bundesliga trip to Mainz. Images showed Boateng appearing to slap Goretzka in the face having reportedly been angered by a mistimed challenge from the former Schalke playmaker. Flick, though, insists the dispute has already been put to bed. “There were a lot of emotions in training. We played a small tournament, every team wanted to win,” Flick told a media conference. “This shows that the attitude of this team is correct. What I didn’t like was the emotionality. “I spoke to both of them on the phone in the evening. I am satisfied that it is in the past. “I don’t want to see this behaviour in the team. We have certain values. These things can be verbally sorted out, that’s what I expect from the team. “I don’t think much of punishments. It happened for the first time under me. “I do not expect such forms of emotion again.” Bayern are a point behind Bundesliga leaders, RB Leipzig, in a fascinating title race. They host Leipzig at the Allianz Arena a week on Sunday, but Flick is adamant their focus is entirely on the challenge posed by Mainz. “It’s important for us to play well in Mainz on Saturday,” he added. “The opponent will put us under pressure in certain situations, switch quickly. They have fast and good players on offense who are looking for a goal. “We think from game to game, Leipzig is of no interest to us at all.” Source: Fotmob Vanguard News Jerome Boateng and Leon Goretzka came to blows during Bayern Munich's training session on Wednesday.
