The National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC) has commended the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA) for considering its female members for leadership of the association. The Director-General (DG), Mr Olusegun Runsewe, gave the commendation in a statement made available to journalists in Lagos by his media aide, Mr Frank Meke, on Saturday. He said this was commendable as it would be coming into being after NANTA’s first attempt 25 years ago. Runsewe with about five female directors working with him to rebrand the culture agency noted that NANTA’s effort was the way to run an all-inclusive association. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that NANTA will hold its next election in Kano in March and some female members will likely be elected to pilot its affairs. Runsewe commended Mr Bankole Bernard for his leadership as the outgoing president of the association in the last four years. ”I must commend Bankole Bernard as President of NANTA for the gut to drive this initiative. It is a big plus for his leadership of NANTA and the tourism sector. ”I am 100 per cent behind him and NANTA on this score,” he said.
